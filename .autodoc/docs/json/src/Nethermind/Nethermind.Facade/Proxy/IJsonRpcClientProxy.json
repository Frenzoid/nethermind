  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `IJsonRpcClientProxy` that is used as a proxy for a JSON-RPC client. The interface contains three methods: `SendAsync<T>`, `SetUrls`, and `SendAsync<T>` with an additional `id` parameter.\n\nThe `SendAsync<T>` method is used to send a JSON-RPC request to a server and receive a response. It takes in two parameters: `method` and `@params`. The `method` parameter is a string that represents the name of the method to be called on the server. The `@params` parameter is an array of objects that represent the parameters to be passed to the method. The method returns a `Task<RpcResult<T>>` object, where `T` is the type of the response expected from the server.\n\nThe second `SendAsync<T>` method is similar to the first one, but it takes an additional `id` parameter. This parameter is used to identify the request and match it with the response received from the server.\n\nThe `SetUrls` method is used to set the URLs of the JSON-RPC servers that the proxy will communicate with. It takes in an array of strings that represent the URLs of the servers.\n\nThis interface is used as a contract for implementing a JSON-RPC client proxy. It provides a way to send requests to a server and receive responses asynchronously. The `SendAsync<T>` method can be used to call any method on the server that is exposed through the JSON-RPC protocol. The `SetUrls` method can be used to set the URLs of the servers that the proxy will communicate with.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface can be used:\n\n```csharp\nIJsonRpcClientProxy proxy = new MyJsonRpcClientProxy();\nproxy.SetUrls(\"http://localhost:8545\");\nTask<RpcResult<string>> result = proxy.SendAsync<string>(\"eth_blockNumber\");\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of a class that implements the `IJsonRpcClientProxy` interface is created. The `SetUrls` method is called to set the URL of the server that the proxy will communicate with. The `SendAsync<T>` method is then called to send a request to the server to get the current block number. The response is returned as a `Task<RpcResult<string>>` object, where `string` is the type of the response expected from the server.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines an interface called `IJsonRpcClientProxy` in the `Nethermind.Facade.Proxy` namespace, which has methods for sending asynchronous RPC requests and setting URLs.\n\n2. What is the `RpcResult<T>` type used for?\n   - The `RpcResult<T>` type is used as the return type for the `SendAsync` methods in the `IJsonRpcClientProxy` interface, and represents the result of an RPC request with a generic type parameter `T`.\n\n3. How are the URLs set in the `SetUrls` method?\n   - The `SetUrls` method takes in a variable number of string parameters, which are used to set the URLs for the RPC client proxy. It is not specified how these URLs are used or what format they should be in.",
