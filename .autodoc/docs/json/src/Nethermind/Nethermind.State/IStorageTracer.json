  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IStorageTracer` that is used to control tracing of storage in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to report changes to storage slots and storage access during the execution of the project. \n\nThe `IsTracingStorage` property is used to control tracing of storage. If it is set to `true`, then the `ReportStorageChange` and `ReportStorageRead` methods will be called to report changes to storage slots and storage access. If it is set to `false`, then these methods will not be called.\n\nThe `ReportStorageChange` method is used to report a change to a storage slot for a given key. It takes in two parameters: `key` and `value`, which represent the key and value of the storage slot that has changed. There is also an overload of this method that takes in a `StorageCell` object, which represents the storage cell that has changed, as well as the `before` and `after` values of the storage cell.\n\nThe `ReportStorageRead` method is used to report storage access for a given storage cell. It takes in a `StorageCell` object as a parameter, which represents the storage cell that has been accessed.\n\nOverall, this interface provides a way to trace changes to storage slots and storage access during the execution of the Nethermind project. It can be used to debug issues related to storage and to gain insight into how storage is being used in the project. Here is an example of how this interface might be used in the larger project:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyContract : SmartContract\n{\n    private readonly IStorageTracer _storageTracer;\n\n    public MyContract(IStorageTracer storageTracer)\n    {\n        _storageTracer = storageTracer;\n    }\n\n    public void SetValue(byte[] key, byte[] value)\n    {\n        _storageTracer.ReportStorageChange(key, value);\n        Storage.Put(key, value);\n    }\n\n    public byte[] GetValue(byte[] key)\n    {\n        _storageTracer.ReportStorageRead(new StorageCell(Address, key));\n        return Storage.Get(key);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyContract` class takes in an instance of `IStorageTracer` in its constructor. The `SetValue` method reports changes to storage using the `ReportStorageChange` method, and the `GetValue` method reports storage access using the `ReportStorageRead` method. This allows the contract to be traced and debugged using the `IStorageTracer` interface.",
