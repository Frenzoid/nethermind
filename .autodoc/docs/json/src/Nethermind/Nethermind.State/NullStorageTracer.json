  "summary": "The code defines a class called `NullStorageTracer` that implements the `IStorageTracer` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a default implementation of the `IStorageTracer` interface that does nothing. \n\nThe `IStorageTracer` interface is used to trace changes to the storage of the Ethereum blockchain. It provides methods to report changes to the storage, as well as reads from the storage. The `NullStorageTracer` class provides a default implementation of this interface that does not actually trace any changes to the storage. \n\nThe class has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. Instead, it provides a static property called `Instance` that returns an instance of the class. This instance can be used as a default implementation of the `IStorageTracer` interface. \n\nThe class also defines a constant string called `ErrorMessage`, which is used in the implementation of the `ReportStorageChange` and `ReportStorageRead` methods. These methods throw an `InvalidOperationException` with the `ErrorMessage` string as the message. This is because the `NullStorageTracer` class should never receive any calls to these methods, since it does not actually trace any changes to the storage. \n\nOverall, the `NullStorageTracer` class provides a default implementation of the `IStorageTracer` interface that does nothing. It can be used as a placeholder implementation when a real implementation is not needed or when tracing storage changes is not required. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\n// Get an instance of the NullStorageTracer\nIStorageTracer tracer = NullStorageTracer.Instance;\n\n// Use the tracer to report a storage change (this will throw an exception)\ntracer.ReportStorageChange(new StorageCell(), new byte[] { 0x01 }, new byte[] { 0x02 });\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines a class called `NullStorageTracer` which implements the `IStorageTracer` interface.\n\n2. What is the `IStorageTracer` interface and what methods does it define?\n   - The `IStorageTracer` interface is not defined in this code file, but it is used as a type for the `NullStorageTracer` class. It likely defines methods for tracing storage changes and reads.\n\n3. Why does the `NullStorageTracer` class throw an `InvalidOperationException` for all of its methods?\n   - The `NullStorageTracer` class is meant to be used as a placeholder when tracing storage is not needed. By throwing an exception for all of its methods, it ensures that no tracing is actually performed.",
