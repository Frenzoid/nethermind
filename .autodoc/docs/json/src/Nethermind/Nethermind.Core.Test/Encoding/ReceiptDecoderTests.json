  "summary": "The `ReceiptDecoderTests` class is a test suite for the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` and `ReceiptMessageDecoder` classes in the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Encoding` namespace. These classes are responsible for encoding and decoding Ethereum transaction receipts in RLP format. \n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_storage` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format. The method takes four parameters: `encodeWithTxHash`, `encodeBehaviors`, `withError`, and `valueDecoder`. The `encodeWithTxHash` parameter specifies whether the transaction hash should be included in the encoded RLP. The `encodeBehaviors` parameter specifies the RLP encoding behaviors to use. The `withError` parameter specifies whether the receipt should have an error. The `valueDecoder` parameter specifies whether to use the `Rlp.ValueDecoderContext` to decode the RLP. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object using the `BuildReceipt` method, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` or `Rlp.ValueDecoderContext`, depending on the `valueDecoder` parameter. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `FluentAssertions` library.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_storage_eip` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format with EIP-658 receipt encoding. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` with the `RlpBehaviors.Storage | RlpBehaviors.Eip658Receipts` parameter, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `AssertStorageReceipt` method.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_root` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format without the block hash, block number, index, contract address, sender, gas used, and recipient fields. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `Assert.AreEqual` method.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_storage_rlp_stream` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format using an `RlpStream`. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` with an `RlpStream`. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `AssertStorageReceipt` method.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_none_rlp_stream` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptMessageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format using an `RlpStream`. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values, encodes it using the `ReceiptMessageDecoder`, and then decodes it using the `Rlp.Decode` method with the `RlpBehaviors.None` parameter. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `AssertMessageReceipt` method.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_with_receipt_message_and_tx_type_access_list` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptMessageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format with the `TxType.AccessList` field. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values and the `TxType.AccessList` field, encodes it using the `ReceiptMessageDecoder`, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptMessageDecoder`. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `AssertMessageReceipt` method.\n\nThe `Can_do_roundtrip_with_storage_receipt_and_tx_type_access_list` method tests the ability of the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` to encode and decode a transaction receipt in RLP format with the `TxType.AccessList` field. The method creates a `TxReceipt` object with specific values and the `TxType.AccessList` field, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` with the `RlpBehaviors.Storage | RlpBehaviors.Eip658Receipts` parameter, and then decodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder`. The decoded `TxReceipt` is then compared to the expected `TxReceipt` using the `AssertStorageReceipt` method.\n\nThe `Netty_and_rlp_array_encoding_should_be_the_same` method tests the consistency of the RLP encoding between the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` and the `NettyRlpStream` classes. The method creates an array of two `TxReceipt` objects, encodes it using the `ReceiptStorageDecoder` and the `NettyRlpStream`, and then compares the resulting byte arrays using the `FluentAssertions` library.\n\nThe `TestCaseSource` method returns a list of `TxReceipt` objects with specific values and descriptions for use in the `Can_do_roundtrip_with_storage_receipt` and `Can_do_roundtrip_with_receipt_message` methods.\n\nThe `AssertMessageReceipt` and `AssertStorageReceipt` methods compare two `TxReceipt` objects and assert that their fields are equal.",
