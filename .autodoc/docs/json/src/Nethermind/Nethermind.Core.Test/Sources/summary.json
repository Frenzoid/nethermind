      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a class called `TxTypeSource` that provides two static properties, `Any` and `Existing`, which return collections of `TxType` values.\n\n2. What is `TxType` and where is it defined?\n   - `TxType` is a type that is used in this code, but it is not defined in this file. It is likely defined elsewhere in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace or one of its dependencies.\n\n3. Why are some of the `TxType` values cast to integers?\n   - Some of the `TxType` values are cast to integers because they are not defined as enum members, but are still valid values for `TxType`. The cast allows them to be included in the collections returned by `Any` and `Existing`.",
