  "summary": "This code defines a class called `Build` in the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide methods for building different types of transactions. \n\nThe `TransactionBuilder` class is a generic class that takes a type parameter that must be a subclass of `Transaction`. The `Build` class provides four methods that return instances of `TransactionBuilder` for different types of transactions: `Transaction`, `SystemTransaction`, `GeneratedTransaction`, and `TypedTransaction<T>()`. \n\nThe `Transaction` method returns a `TransactionBuilder` for a regular transaction. The `SystemTransaction` method returns a `TransactionBuilder` for a system transaction, which is a special type of transaction used for internal operations within the Ethereum network. The `GeneratedTransaction` method returns a `TransactionBuilder` for a generated transaction, which is a transaction that is created for testing purposes. The `TypedTransaction<T>()` method is a generic method that returns a `TransactionBuilder` for a transaction of a specific type `T`, which must be a subclass of `Transaction`.\n\nThe `NamedTransaction(string name)` method returns a `TransactionBuilder` for a named transaction. This method takes a string parameter `name` that is used to set the `Name` property of the `TestObjectInternal` property of the `TransactionBuilder`. This property is used for testing purposes to give a name to the transaction being built.\n\nOverall, this class provides a convenient way to create different types of transactions for testing purposes. For example, a unit test for a method that processes transactions could use the `Transaction` method to create a regular transaction, and then use the `SystemTransaction` method to create a system transaction to test a different code path. The `NamedTransaction` method could be used to create transactions with specific names to test different scenarios.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Build` class?\n   - The `Build` class is a partial class that provides methods for building different types of transactions.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `TransactionBuilder` class?\n   - The `TransactionBuilder` class is a generic class that is used to build different types of transactions, including `Transaction`, `SystemTransaction`, `GeneratedTransaction`, and any other type of transaction that inherits from `Transaction`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `NamedTransaction` method?\n   - The `NamedTransaction` method is used to create a new `TransactionBuilder` instance for a `NamedTransaction` and set its `Name` property to the specified `name` parameter.",
