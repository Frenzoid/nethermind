  "summary": "The `Prepare` class is a utility class that provides an easy way to construct common patterns of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode. The class is located in the `Nethermind.Evm` namespace and is part of the Nethermind project.\n\nThe `Prepare` class provides a set of methods that allow the user to construct EVM bytecode for various operations such as creating a contract, calling a contract, and storing data in memory or storage. The class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the Nethermind project to build more complex smart contracts.\n\nThe `Prepare` class has a private field `_byteCode` that is a list of bytes representing the EVM bytecode being constructed. The class has a public method `Done` that returns the constructed bytecode as a byte array.\n\nThe `Prepare` class provides methods for constructing EVM bytecode for the following operations:\n\n- Creating a contract: The `Create` and `Create2` methods allow the user to construct EVM bytecode for creating a new contract. The `Create` method takes a byte array representing the contract code, a `UInt256` value representing the amount of ether to send with the contract creation, and constructs the EVM bytecode for creating a new contract. The `Create2` method is similar to the `Create` method, but also takes a byte array representing a salt value that is used to derive the contract address.\n\n- Calling a contract: The `Call`, `CallWithValue`, `CallWithInput`, `DelegateCall`, and `StaticCall` methods allow the user to construct EVM bytecode for calling a contract. These methods take various parameters such as the contract address, gas limit, and input data, and construct the EVM bytecode for calling the contract.\n\n- Storing data: The `PersistData`, `StoreDataInMemory`, and `StoreDataInTransientStorage` methods allow the user to construct EVM bytecode for storing data in various types of storage. The `PersistData` method stores data in persistent storage, while the `StoreDataInMemory` and `StoreDataInTransientStorage` methods store data in memory and transient storage, respectively.\n\n- Other operations: The `FromCode`, `Data`, and `Return` methods allow the user to construct EVM bytecode for other operations such as loading data from memory, returning data from a contract, and more.\n\nOverall, the `Prepare` class provides a convenient way to construct EVM bytecode for common operations in smart contract development. The class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the Nethermind project to build more complex smart contracts.",
