  "summary": "The `Snarks` folder in the `Nethermind.Evm/Precompiles` directory contains code related to precompiled contracts that implement zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\nThe `Groth16` subfolder contains code for the Groth16 zk-SNARK precompiled contract. This contract is used to verify the validity of a proof that a prover has knowledge of a secret value that satisfies a certain condition, without revealing any information about the secret value itself. This is useful for privacy-preserving applications such as anonymous voting or confidential transactions.\n\nThe `MiMC` subfolder contains code for the MiMC zk-SNARK precompiled contract. This contract is used to verify the validity of a proof that a prover has knowledge of a preimage that hashes to a certain value using the MiMC hash function. This is useful for applications such as private set intersection or private identity verification.\n\nThe `Rescue` subfolder contains code for the Rescue zk-SNARK precompiled contract. This contract is used to verify the validity of a proof that a prover has knowledge of a preimage that hashes to a certain value using the Rescue hash function. This is useful for applications such as private set intersection or private identity verification.\n\nThese precompiled contracts are implemented in assembly language for efficiency reasons. They are used by other parts of the Nethermind project, such as the EVM implementation, to provide privacy-preserving functionality to Ethereum smart contracts. \n\nDevelopers can use these precompiled contracts in their own smart contracts by calling the appropriate function with the necessary inputs. For example, to verify a Groth16 proof, a developer could call the `groth16Verify` function with the proof, public inputs, and verification key as arguments. \n\nOverall, the `Snarks` folder in the `Nethermind.Evm/Precompiles` directory contains important code for implementing privacy-preserving functionality in Ethereum smart contracts using zk-SNARKs.",
