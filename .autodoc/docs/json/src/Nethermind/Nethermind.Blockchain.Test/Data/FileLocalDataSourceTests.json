  "summary": "The `FileLocalDataSourceTests` class contains unit tests for the `FileLocalDataSource` class, which is responsible for reading and updating data from a file. The purpose of this class is to provide a simple way to store and retrieve data from a file, while also allowing for automatic updates when the file changes.\n\nThe `correctly_reads_existing_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly read data from an existing file. It creates a temporary file, writes some data to it, and then creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file. It then asserts that the data read from the file is equivalent to the data that was written to it.\n\nThe `correctly_updates_from_existing_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly update its data when the file changes. It creates a temporary file, writes some data to it, and then creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file. It then writes some new data to the file, and waits for the `FileLocalDataSource` instance to update its data. It asserts that the data read from the file is equivalent to the new data that was written to it.\n\nThe `correctly_updates_from_new_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly update its data when a new file is created. It creates a temporary file, creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file, and then writes some new data to the file. It waits for the `FileLocalDataSource` instance to update its data, and then asserts that the data read from the file is equivalent to the new data that was written to it.\n\nThe `loads_default_when_failed_loading_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly handle errors when loading data from a file. It creates a temporary file, opens it for writing, and then creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file. It asserts that the data read from the file is equivalent to the default value for the data type.\n\nThe `retries_loading_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly handle errors when loading data from a file. It creates a temporary file, writes some data to it, and then creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file. It then opens the file for writing, writes some new data to it, and waits for the `FileLocalDataSource` instance to update its data. It asserts that the data read from the file is equivalent to the new data that was written to it.\n\nThe `loads_default_when_deleted_file` test verifies that the `FileLocalDataSource` class can correctly handle errors when a file is deleted. It creates a temporary file, writes some data to it, and then creates a new instance of the `FileLocalDataSource` class to read the data from the file. It then writes some new data to the file, waits for the `FileLocalDataSource` instance to update its data, deletes the file, and waits for the `FileLocalDataSource` instance to update its data again. It asserts that the data read from the file is null, indicating that the file was deleted.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FileLocalDataSource` class?\n- The `FileLocalDataSource` class is used to read and update data from a file using a specified serializer.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `GenerateStringJson` method?\n- The `GenerateStringJson` method is used to generate a JSON string from an array of strings.\n\n3. Why are some of the tests marked with `[Ignore]` or `[Retry]` attributes?\n- Some of the tests are marked with `[Ignore]` or `[Retry]` attributes because they are known to be flaky or cause issues on certain platforms, and are therefore not reliable enough to be run consistently.",
