  "summary": "The `AuRaContext` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for testing purposes. It extends the `TestContextBase` class and provides methods for reading block authors and block numbers. \n\nThe `ReadBlockAuthors` method reads the block authors for all the blocks in the current state. It does this by iterating over all the blocks in the state and calling the `ReadBlockAuthor` method for each block. \n\nThe `ReadBlockNumber` method reads the current block number from the JSON-RPC client. It does this by calling the `eth_blockNumber` method on the client and updating the state with the result. \n\nThe `ReadBlockAuthor` method reads the block author for a specific block number. It does this by calling the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method on the JSON-RPC client with the block number as a parameter. It then updates the state with the block number and the miner address. \n\nOverall, the `AuRaContext` class provides a convenient way to read block authors and block numbers for testing purposes. It can be used in conjunction with other testing classes in the Nethermind project to ensure that the blockchain is functioning correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// create a new AuRaState object\nAuRaState state = new AuRaState();\n\n// create a new AuRaContext object with the state\nAuRaContext context = new AuRaContext(state);\n\n// read the block number and block authors\ncontext.ReadBlockNumber().ReadBlockAuthors();\n\n// print the block number and block authors\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Block number: {state.BlocksCount}\");\nforeach (var block in state.Blocks)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Block {block.Key}: Miner {block.Value.Item1}, Step {block.Value.Item2}\");\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AuRaContext` class?\n    \n    The `AuRaContext` class is a test context class that inherits from `TestContextBase` and provides methods for reading block authors and block numbers using JSON-RPC.\n\n2. What is the `ReadBlockAuthors` method doing?\n    \n    The `ReadBlockAuthors` method is iterating through the blocks in the `State` object and calling the `ReadBlockAuthor` method for each block number.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `AddJsonRpc` method?\n    \n    The `AddJsonRpc` method is a helper method that adds a JSON-RPC call to the test context and updates the `State` object with the result of the call. It takes in a description of the call, the JSON-RPC method name, a lambda function that makes the call, and a lambda function that updates the `State` object with the result.",
