  "summary": "The `WmicCpuInfoParser` class is responsible for parsing the output of the `wmic cpu` command and returning a `CpuInfo` object. The `CpuInfo` object contains information about the CPU(s) of the system, such as the number of physical and logical cores, clock speeds, and processor model names.\n\nThe `ParseOutput` method takes a string as input, which is the output of the `wmic cpu` command. It then uses the `SectionsHelper.ParseSections` method to split the output into sections, using the `=` character as a delimiter. Each section represents a CPU on the system.\n\nThe method then iterates over each section and extracts the relevant information, such as the number of physical and logical cores, processor model names, and clock speeds. It uses a `HashSet` to keep track of the processor model names, and increments counters for the number of physical and logical cores and processors.\n\nFinally, the method returns a `CpuInfo` object with the extracted information. If any of the information is missing or invalid, it returns `null` for that field.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `WmicCpuInfoParser` class:\n\n```csharp\nstring output = \"NumberOfCores=4\\nNumberOfLogicalProcessors=8\\nName=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz\\nMaxClockSpeed=3201\\n\";\n\nCpuInfo cpuInfo = WmicCpuInfoParser.ParseOutput(output);\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Processor Model Names: {cpuInfo.ProcessorModelNames}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Number of Processors: {cpuInfo.ProcessorsCount}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Number of Physical Cores: {cpuInfo.PhysicalCoreCount}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Number of Logical Cores: {cpuInfo.LogicalCoreCount}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Current Clock Speed: {cpuInfo.CurrentClockSpeed}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Minimum Clock Speed: {cpuInfo.MinClockSpeed}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Maximum Clock Speed: {cpuInfo.MaxClockSpeed}\");\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nProcessor Model Names: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz\nNumber of Processors: 1\nNumber of Physical Cores: 4\nNumber of Logical Cores: 8\nCurrent Clock Speed: 3201 MHz\nMinimum Clock Speed: 0 MHz\nMaximum Clock Speed: 3201 MHz\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WmicCpuInfoParser` class?\n    \n    The `WmicCpuInfoParser` class is used to parse CPU information from a string of content and return a `CpuInfo` object.\n\n2. What is the source of the `SectionsHelper` class used in this file?\n    \n    The `SectionsHelper` class is derived from the `BenchmarkDotNet` project on GitHub and is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n3. What is the `CpuInfo` object returned by the `ParseOutput` method?\n    \n    The `CpuInfo` object contains information about the CPU, including the processor model names, number of processors, physical and logical core counts, and clock speeds.",
