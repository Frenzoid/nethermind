  "summary": "The `ConsoleExitHandler` class is a utility class that provides functionality to handle the exit of a console application. It is used in the `Nethermind` project to ensure that the application is properly terminated when the user closes the console window or presses Ctrl+C.\n\nThe class implements the `IDisposable` interface, which allows it to be used in a `using` statement to ensure that the resources it uses are properly disposed of. The constructor takes a `Process` object as a parameter, which is the process that the `ConsoleExitHandler` will monitor for exit events.\n\nThe `Attach` method is called from the constructor and sets up the event handlers for the `Exited`, `CancelKeyPress`, and `ProcessExit` events. The `Detach` method removes these event handlers when the `ConsoleExitHandler` is disposed of.\n\nThe `ProcessOnExited` method is called when the monitored process has exited. It calls the `Detach` method to remove the event handlers.\n\nThe `CancelKeyPressHandlerCallback` method is called when the user presses Ctrl+C. It calls the `KillProcessTree` method to terminate the entire process tree.\n\nThe `ProcessExitEventHandlerHandlerCallback` method is called when the user closes the console window. It also calls the `KillProcessTree` method to terminate the entire process tree.\n\nThe `KillProcessTree` method is called by the `CancelKeyPressHandlerCallback` and `ProcessExitEventHandlerHandlerCallback` methods to terminate the entire process tree. It calls the `KillTree` method on the monitored process to terminate the process and all of its child processes.\n\nOverall, the `ConsoleExitHandler` class provides a simple and reliable way to ensure that a console application is properly terminated when the user closes the console window or presses Ctrl+C. It is a useful utility class that can be used in any console application that needs to handle these events. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing Nethermind.Init.Cpu;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Process process = new Process();\n        // configure process here\n        using (ConsoleExitHandler exitHandler = new ConsoleExitHandler(process))\n        {\n            // run process here\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
