  "summary": "The `StepInfo` class is a utility class used in the `Nethermind` project to provide information about a specific step in the initialization process. The class takes two parameters, `type` and `baseType`, which are used to initialize the `StepType` and `StepBaseType` properties respectively. \n\nThe `StepType` property represents the type of the step, while the `StepBaseType` property represents the base type of the step. The `Dependencies` property is an array of types that represent the dependencies of the step. These dependencies are specified using the `RunnerStepDependenciesAttribute` attribute, which is defined in another part of the project.\n\nThe `Stage` property is used to specify the initialization stage of the step. This property is set externally and is not used in the constructor.\n\nThe `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `StepInfo` object. The string representation includes the name of the step type, the name of the base type, and the initialization stage.\n\nThis class is used in the initialization process of the `Nethermind` project to provide information about each step in the process. The `StepInfo` objects are created for each step and are used to determine the dependencies of each step. This information is used to ensure that the steps are executed in the correct order and that all dependencies are satisfied before a step is executed.\n\nHere is an example of how the `StepInfo` class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nStepInfo stepInfo = new StepInfo(typeof(MyStep), typeof(BaseStep));\nstepInfo.Stage = StepInitializationStage.PreValidation;\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `StepInfo` object is created for a step called `MyStep`, which inherits from `BaseStep`. The `Stage` property is set to `StepInitializationStage.PreValidation`. This `StepInfo` object can then be used to determine the dependencies of the `MyStep` step and ensure that it is executed in the correct order during the initialization process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StepInfo` class?\n    \n    The `StepInfo` class is used to store information about a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project, including its type, base type, dependencies, and initialization stage.\n\n2. What happens if the `type` parameter passed to the `StepInfo` constructor is abstract?\n    \n    If the `type` parameter passed to the `StepInfo` constructor is abstract, an `ArgumentException` will be thrown with the message \"Step type cannot be abstract\".\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ToString` method in the `StepInfo` class?\n    \n    The `ToString` method in the `StepInfo` class returns a string representation of the step's type and base type, along with its initialization stage, in the format \"{StepType.Name} : {StepBaseType.Name} ({Stage})\".",
