  "summary": "The `EthereumStepsLoader` class is responsible for loading and selecting the appropriate implementation of `IStep` objects based on the provided `INethermindApi` type. \n\nThe class takes in one or more `Assembly` objects that contain the `IStep` implementations. The `LoadSteps` method takes in an `apiType` parameter, which is used to filter the `IStep` implementations based on whether they have a constructor that takes in an instance of the `apiType`. If no `IStep` implementations are found that match the `apiType`, then the method looks for implementations that take in an instance of the `INethermindApi` type. \n\nThe `LoadSteps` method returns an `IEnumerable` of `StepInfo` objects, which contain information about the `IStep` implementation and its base type. The `SelectImplementation` method is used to select the appropriate `StepInfo` object based on the provided `apiType`. If multiple `IStep` implementations are found that match the `apiType`, then the method selects the implementation that is assignable from the other implementations. \n\nOverall, this class is used to dynamically load and select the appropriate `IStep` implementations based on the provided `apiType`. This is useful in the larger project because it allows for greater flexibility and modularity in the codebase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\nvar loader = new EthereumStepsLoader(assembly1, assembly2);\nvar steps = loader.LoadSteps(typeof(MyNethermindApi));\nforeach (var step in steps)\n{\n    var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(step.StepType, myNethermindApiInstance);\n    // do something with instance\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EthereumStepsLoader` class?\n    \n    The `EthereumStepsLoader` class is responsible for loading and selecting the appropriate implementation of `IStep` for a given `INethermindApi` implementation.\n\n2. What is the `LoadSteps` method responsible for?\n    \n    The `LoadSteps` method takes a `Type` parameter representing an `INethermindApi` implementation, and returns an `IEnumerable` of `StepInfo` objects representing the available `IStep` implementations that can be used with the given `INethermindApi` implementation.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SelectImplementation` method?\n    \n    The `SelectImplementation` method is responsible for selecting the appropriate `StepInfo` object from an array of `StepInfo` objects that share the same base type, based on whether or not the `StepInfo` object's `StepType` has a constructor that takes an `INethermindApi` implementation or the base `INethermindApi` type.",
