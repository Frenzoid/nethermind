  "summary": "The `SnapProviderHelper` class in the `Nethermind` project provides helper methods for adding account and storage ranges to a state tree. The purpose of this class is to assist with the synchronization of state data between nodes in the network. \n\nThe `AddAccountRange` method takes in a `StateTree` object, a block number, an expected root hash, a starting hash, a limit hash, an array of `PathWithAccount` objects, and an optional array of proofs. The method first checks the boundaries and sorting of the accounts, then fills a boundary tree with the necessary nodes to add the accounts to the state tree. The method then adds the accounts to the state tree, updates the root hash, and commits the changes. The method returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the success or failure of the operation, a boolean indicating whether there are more children to the right of the range, a list of `PathWithAccount` objects containing the storage roots of the accounts, and a list of `Keccak` objects containing the code hashes of the accounts.\n\nThe `AddStorageRange` method takes in a `StorageTree` object, a block number, a starting hash, an array of `PathWithStorageSlot` objects, an expected root hash, and an optional array of proofs. The method checks the boundaries and sorting of the storage slots, fills a boundary tree with the necessary nodes to add the slots to the storage tree, adds the slots to the storage tree, updates the root hash, and commits the changes. The method returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the success or failure of the operation, and a boolean indicating whether there are more children to the right of the range.\n\nThe `FillBoundaryTree` method is a private method used by both `AddAccountRange` and `AddStorageRange`. This method takes in a `PatriciaTree` object, a starting hash, an end hash, a limit hash, an expected root hash, and an optional array of proofs. The method creates a dictionary of `Keccak` keys and `TrieNode` values from the proofs, then fills a boundary tree with the necessary nodes to add the range to the tree. The method returns a tuple containing an `AddRangeResult` enum value indicating the success or failure of the operation, a list of `TrieNode` objects representing the sorted boundary list, and a boolean indicating whether there are more children to the right of the range.\n\nThe `CreateProofDict` method is a private method used by `FillBoundaryTree` to create a dictionary of `Keccak` keys and `TrieNode` values from an array of proofs.\n\nThe `StitchBoundaries` method is a private method used by `FillBoundaryTree` to stitch together the boundary nodes in the sorted boundary list.\n\nThe `IsChildPersisted` method is a private method used by `StitchBoundaries` to determine if a child node is persisted in the trie store.\n\nOverall, the `SnapProviderHelper` class provides useful helper methods for adding account and storage ranges to a state tree, which is essential for synchronizing state data between nodes in the network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SnapProviderHelper` class?\n- The `SnapProviderHelper` class provides helper methods for adding account and storage ranges to a state tree or storage tree during snapshot synchronization.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `FillBoundaryTree` method?\n- The `FillBoundaryTree` method fills a boundary tree with nodes from a proof dictionary, and returns a sorted list of boundary nodes and a boolean indicating whether there are more children to the right of the last node.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StitchBoundaries` method?\n- The `StitchBoundaries` method sets the `IsBoundaryProofNode` flag on boundary nodes in a sorted list of boundary nodes based on whether their children are persisted in the trie store.",
