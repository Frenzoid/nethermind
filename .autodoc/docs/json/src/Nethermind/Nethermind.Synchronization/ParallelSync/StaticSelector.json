  "summary": "The `StaticSelector` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is used for selecting a synchronization mode for the blockchain. It implements the `ISyncModeSelector` interface, which defines the methods and properties required for selecting a synchronization mode. \n\nThe `StaticSelector` class has several static properties that represent different synchronization modes. These properties are `Full`, `FastSync`, `FastBlocks`, `FastSyncWithFastBlocks`, `StateNodesWithFastBlocks`, and `FullWithFastBlocks`. Each of these properties is an instance of the `StaticSelector` class, initialized with a specific `SyncMode` value. \n\nThe `SyncMode` enumeration is a set of flags that represent different synchronization modes. The available synchronization modes are `Full`, `FastSync`, `FastBlocks`, and `StateNodes`. The `FastSyncWithFastBlocks` mode is a combination of `FastSync` and `FastBlocks`, while the `StateNodesWithFastBlocks` mode is a combination of `StateNodes` and `FastBlocks`. The `FullWithFastBlocks` mode is a combination of `Full` and `FastBlocks`.\n\nThe `StaticSelector` class also has a `Current` property that represents the currently selected synchronization mode. This property is set in the constructor of the `StaticSelector` class and cannot be changed afterwards. \n\nThe `StaticSelector` class implements several events, including `Preparing`, `Changed`, and `Changing`. These events are not used in the current implementation of the `StaticSelector` class and are empty. \n\nThe `Stop` method and the `Dispose` method are also implemented in the `StaticSelector` class, but they do not have any functionality in the current implementation. \n\nOverall, the `StaticSelector` class provides a simple way to select a synchronization mode for the blockchain in the `Nethermind` project. Developers can use the static properties of the `StaticSelector` class to select a synchronization mode and then use the `Current` property to retrieve the currently selected synchronization mode.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StaticSelector` class?\n    \n    The `StaticSelector` class is used for selecting a synchronization mode for the Nethermind project.\n\n2. What are the different synchronization modes available in this code?\n    \n    The different synchronization modes available in this code are `Full`, `FastSync`, `FastBlocks`, `FastSyncWithFastBlocks`, `StateNodesWithFastBlocks`, and `FullWithFastBlocks`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Preparing`, `Changed`, and `Changing` events in the `StaticSelector` class?\n    \n    The `Preparing`, `Changed`, and `Changing` events are placeholders and do not have any functionality in the current implementation of the `StaticSelector` class. They may be used in future implementations of the class.",
