  "summary": "The `UserOperationBuilder` class is a test utility class that provides a convenient way to create instances of the `UserOperation` class. The `UserOperation` class is used to represent a user operation in the Nethermind Ethereum client. \n\nThe `UserOperationBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for setting the various properties of a `UserOperation` instance. The `WithSender`, `WithNonce`, `WithPaymaster`, `WithCallData`, `WithInitCode`, `WithPaymasterData`, `WithMaxFeePerGas`, `WithMaxPriorityFeePerGas`, `WithCallGas`, `WithVerificationGas`, and `WithPreVerificationGas` methods are used to set the corresponding properties of a `UserOperation` instance. \n\nThe `SignedAndResolved` method is used to sign a `UserOperation` instance with a private key and resolve it to an Ethereum address. This method takes three optional parameters: `privateKey`, `entryPointAddress`, and `chainId`. If `privateKey` is not provided, a default ignored private key is used. If `entryPointAddress` is not provided, the zero address is used. If `chainId` is not provided, the value 1 is used. \n\nThe `UserOperationBuilder` class is used in the Nethermind test suite to create instances of the `UserOperation` class for testing purposes. For example, the following code creates a `UserOperation` instance with a sender address of `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`, a nonce of `42`, and a maximum fee per gas of `1000000000` wei:\n\n```\nUserOperation userOp = new UserOperationBuilder()\n    .WithSender(Address.FromHexString(\"0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890\"))\n    .WithNonce(UInt256.FromBytes(new byte[] { 42 }))\n    .WithMaxFeePerGas(1000000000)\n    .Build();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `UserOperationBuilder` class?\n    \n    The `UserOperationBuilder` class is used to build instances of the `UserOperation` class, which represents a user operation in the Nethermind system. It provides methods for setting various properties of the `UserOperation` instance, such as the sender, nonce, paymaster, call data, and gas limits.\n\n2. What is the `SignedAndResolved` method used for?\n    \n    The `SignedAndResolved` method is used to sign a `UserOperation` instance with a private key and resolve it to an `AccountAbstractionRequest` instance. It takes optional parameters for the private key, entry point address, and chain ID, and uses them to sign the `UserOperation` instance and construct the `AccountAbstractionRequest` instance.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `AccountAbstractionRpcModuleTests.SignUserOperation` method?\n    \n    The `AccountAbstractionRpcModuleTests.SignUserOperation` method is used to sign a `UserOperation` instance with a private key, entry point address, and chain ID. It constructs a `RequestID` instance from the `UserOperation` instance and signs it using the private key, and then sets the `Signature` property of the `UserOperation` instance to the resulting signature.",
