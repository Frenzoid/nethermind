  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `EthStatsConfig` that implements the `IEthStatsConfig` interface. This class is responsible for holding configuration settings related to the EthStats feature in the Nethermind project. \n\nThe `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether or not EthStats is enabled. If it is set to `true`, then EthStats will be enabled and will start sending data to the specified server. If it is set to `false`, then EthStats will be disabled and no data will be sent.\n\nThe `Server` property is a string that specifies the URL of the EthStats server. By default, it is set to `ws://localhost:3000/api`, which is the URL of the local EthStats server. This can be changed to point to a different server if needed.\n\nThe `Name` property is a string that specifies the name of the node that is sending data to the EthStats server. By default, it is set to \"Nethermind\", which is the name of the Nethermind node. This can be changed to a different name if needed.\n\nThe `Secret` property is a string that specifies the secret key that is used to authenticate the node with the EthStats server. By default, it is set to \"secret\", which is a default value. This can be changed to a different value if needed.\n\nThe `Contact` property is a string that specifies the contact email address for the node. By default, it is set to \"hello@nethermind.io\", which is the contact email address for the Nethermind project. This can be changed to a different email address if needed.\n\nOverall, this class provides a way to configure the EthStats feature in the Nethermind project. By setting the properties of this class, users can enable or disable EthStats, specify the server URL, set the node name, set the secret key, and set the contact email address. This class can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Nethermind project to provide a complete solution for monitoring and analyzing Ethereum network data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// create a new EthStatsConfig object\nEthStatsConfig config = new EthStatsConfig();\n\n// enable EthStats\nconfig.Enabled = true;\n\n// set the server URL\nconfig.Server = \"wss://ethstats.example.com/api\";\n\n// set the node name\nconfig.Name = \"MyNode\";\n\n// set the secret key\nconfig.Secret = \"mysecretkey\";\n\n// set the contact email address\nconfig.Contact = \"admin@example.com\";\n```",
