  "summary": "The `EnrTreeCrawler` class is responsible for crawling an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Resource (ENR) tree and returning a list of node records. The class takes an instance of a logger as an argument in its constructor. The `SearchTree` method is the entry point for the class and takes a domain name as an argument. If the domain name starts with `enrtree://`, the method extracts the domain name from the string and splits it into two parts: the public key of the ENR tree signer and the domain name. The public key is not verified, and the method logs a warning if it is not present. The method then creates a new instance of the `DnsClient` class with the domain name and a new instance of the `SearchContext` class with an empty string.\n\nThe `SearchTree` method then calls the `SearchTree` method with the `DnsClient` and `SearchContext` instances as arguments. The `SearchTree` method is an asynchronous method that returns an `IAsyncEnumerable<string>` object. The method dequeues a reference from the `RefsToVisit` queue in the `SearchContext` object and calls the `SearchNode` method with the `DnsClient`, reference, and `SearchContext` instances as arguments. The `SearchNode` method is an asynchronous method that returns an `IAsyncEnumerable<string>` object. The method checks if the reference has been visited before and adds it to the `VisitedRefs` hash set if it has not. The method then calls the `Lookup` method of the `DnsClient` instance with the reference as an argument. The `Lookup` method returns an `IEnumerable<string>` object that contains the node records for the reference.\n\nThe `SearchNode` method then iterates over the node records and parses them into an `EnrTreeNode` object using the `EnrTreeParser` class. The method then iterates over the links, records, and references in the `EnrTreeNode` object and adds them to the `RefsToVisit` queue in the `SearchContext` object or returns them as a node record. The `SearchTree` method continues to dequeue references from the `RefsToVisit` queue and call the `SearchNode` method until the queue is empty.\n\nThe `SearchContext` class is a private class that contains a `VisitedRefs` hash set and a `RefsToVisit` queue. The `VisitedRefs` hash set contains the references that have been visited, and the `RefsToVisit` queue contains the references that need to be visited.\n\nThe `EnrTreeCrawler` class is used in the larger project to crawl an ENR tree and return a list of node records. The class can be used to retrieve information about Ethereum nodes that are registered in the ENR tree. The class can be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to discover Ethereum nodes and connect to them. An example of how to use the `EnrTreeCrawler` class is as follows:\n\n```csharp\nILogger logger = new ConsoleLogger(LogLevel.Info);\nEnrTreeCrawler enrTreeCrawler = new(logger);\nIAsyncEnumerable<string> nodeRecords = enrTreeCrawler.SearchTree(\"enrtree://publickey@domain.com\");\nawait foreach (string nodeRecord in nodeRecords)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(nodeRecord);\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EnrTreeCrawler` class?\n    \n    The `EnrTreeCrawler` class is used to crawl a DNS tree and return a list of node record texts.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `enrtree://` prefix in the `SearchTree` method?\n    \n    The `enrtree://` prefix is used to indicate that the domain is a DNS tree, and the method will extract the public key and URL from the domain string.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SearchContext` class?\n    \n    The `SearchContext` class is used to keep track of the visited references and the references to visit during the DNS tree traversal.",
