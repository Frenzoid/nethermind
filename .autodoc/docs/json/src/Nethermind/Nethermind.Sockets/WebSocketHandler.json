  "summary": "The `WebSocketHandler` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to handle WebSocket connections. It implements the `ISocketHandler` interface and provides methods to send and receive data over a WebSocket connection.\n\nThe constructor of the `WebSocketHandler` class takes a `WebSocket` object and an `ILogManager` object as parameters. The `WebSocket` object represents the WebSocket connection and the `ILogManager` object is used to get a logger instance. If the `ILogManager` object is null, an `ArgumentNullException` is thrown.\n\nThe `SendRawAsync` method takes an `ArraySegment<byte>` object and a boolean value as parameters. It sends the data over the WebSocket connection if the connection is open. If the connection is not open, the method returns a completed task.\n\nThe `GetReceiveResult` method takes an `ArraySegment<byte>` object as a parameter and returns a `Task<ReceiveResult?>` object. It reads data from the WebSocket connection and returns a `ReceiveResult` object. If the connection is not open, the method returns null. If an exception occurs while reading data from the connection, the method returns a `WebSocketsReceiveResult` object with the `Closed` property set to true.\n\nThe `CloseAsync` method takes a `ReceiveResult?` object as a parameter and closes the WebSocket connection. If the connection is open or in the process of closing, the method closes the connection and returns a completed task. If the connection is already closed, the method returns a completed task.\n\nThe `Dispose` method disposes of the `WebSocket` object.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to handle WebSocket connections. Developers can use the `WebSocketHandler` class to send and receive data over WebSocket connections and close the connections when necessary. For example, the `WebSocketHandler` class can be used in a web application to handle real-time communication between the server and the client.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WebSocketHandler` class?\n    \n    The `WebSocketHandler` class is an implementation of the `ISocketHandler` interface and provides methods for sending and receiving data over a WebSocket connection.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `GetReceiveResult` method?\n    \n    The `GetReceiveResult` method asynchronously receives data from the WebSocket connection and returns a `ReceiveResult` object that contains information about the received data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CloseAsync` method?\n    \n    The `CloseAsync` method closes the WebSocket connection and takes a `ReceiveResult` object as an optional parameter to provide additional information about the reason for closing the connection.",
