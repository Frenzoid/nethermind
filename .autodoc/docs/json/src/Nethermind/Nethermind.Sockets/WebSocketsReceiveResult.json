  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `WebSocketsReceiveResult` that inherits from `ReceiveResult`. This class is used in the `Nethermind` project to handle WebSocket communication. \n\nWebSocket is a protocol that enables two-way communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It is commonly used in web applications to provide real-time updates and notifications to users. \n\nThe `WebSocketsReceiveResult` class adds a property called `CloseStatus` to the `ReceiveResult` class. This property is used to store the status code that is sent by the server when the WebSocket connection is closed. \n\nThe `CloseStatus` property is of type `WebSocketCloseStatus?`, which means it can be null. This is because the WebSocket connection may be closed without a status code being sent by the server. \n\nHere is an example of how the `WebSocketsReceiveResult` class may be used in the `Nethermind` project:\n\n```csharp\nusing Nethermind.Sockets;\nusing System.Net.WebSockets;\n\n// Create a new WebSocket connection\nWebSocket webSocket = new ClientWebSocket();\nawait webSocket.ConnectAsync(new Uri(\"wss://example.com\"), CancellationToken.None);\n\n// Receive data from the WebSocket\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nvar result = await webSocket.ReceiveAsync(new ArraySegment<byte>(buffer), CancellationToken.None);\n\n// Check if the WebSocket connection was closed\nif (result.CloseStatus != null)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"WebSocket connection closed with status code {result.CloseStatus.Value}\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new WebSocket connection using the `ClientWebSocket` class. We then use the `ReceiveAsync` method to receive data from the WebSocket. If the `CloseStatus` property of the `WebSocketsReceiveResult` object returned by `ReceiveAsync` is not null, we print a message indicating that the WebSocket connection was closed and the status code that was sent by the server. \n\nOverall, the `WebSocketsReceiveResult` class is a small but important part of the `Nethermind` project's WebSocket communication functionality. It allows the project to handle WebSocket connection closures in a more robust and flexible way.",
