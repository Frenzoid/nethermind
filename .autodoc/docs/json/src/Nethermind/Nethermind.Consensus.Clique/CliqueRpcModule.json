  "summary": "The `CliqueRpcModule` class is a module that provides an implementation of the Clique consensus algorithm for the Nethermind Ethereum client. The Clique consensus algorithm is a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm that allows a group of pre-approved validators to create new blocks in the blockchain. \n\nThe `CliqueRpcModule` class provides methods for producing new blocks, casting and uncasting votes, and retrieving information about the current state of the blockchain. The class implements the `ICliqueRpcModule` interface, which defines the methods that must be implemented by a Clique consensus module.\n\nThe `ProduceBlock` method is used to produce a new block on top of a given parent block. The method takes a `Keccak` hash of the parent block as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the block was successfully produced. If the `ICliqueBlockProducer` instance associated with the module is null, the method returns false.\n\nThe `CastVote` and `UncastVote` methods are used to cast and uncast votes, respectively. The `CastVote` method takes an `Address` representing the signer and a boolean value indicating the vote as arguments. The `UncastVote` method takes an `Address` representing the signer as an argument. If the `ICliqueBlockProducer` instance associated with the module is null, both methods throw an `InvalidOperationException` with the message \"Not a signer node - cannot vote\".\n\nThe `GetSnapshot` method is used to retrieve a snapshot of the current state of the blockchain. The method has two overloads: one that takes no arguments and returns a snapshot of the current head block, and one that takes a `Keccak` hash of a block and returns a snapshot of that block. The method returns a `Snapshot` object that contains information about the current state of the blockchain.\n\nThe `GetSigners` methods are used to retrieve the list of signers for the current head block or a specific block. The methods have three overloads: one that takes no arguments and returns an array of `Address` objects representing the signers for the current head block, one that takes a `Keccak` hash of a block and returns an array of `Address` objects representing the signers for that block, and one that takes a `long` representing the block number and returns an array of `Address` objects representing the signers for that block.\n\nThe `GetSignersAnnotated` methods are similar to the `GetSigners` methods, but they return an array of strings that includes a description of each signer. The description is obtained from the `KnownAddresses` class, which maps well-known Ethereum addresses to human-readable descriptions.\n\nThe `clique_produceBlock`, `clique_getSnapshot`, `clique_getSnapshotAtHash`, `clique_getSigners`, `clique_getSignersAtHash`, `clique_getSignersAtNumber`, `clique_getSignersAnnotated`, `clique_getSignersAtHashAnnotated`, `clique_getBlockSigner`, `clique_propose`, and `clique_discard` methods are RPC methods that can be called by an Ethereum client to interact with the Clique consensus module. These methods return `ResultWrapper` objects that contain the result of the method call or an error message if the method call fails.",
