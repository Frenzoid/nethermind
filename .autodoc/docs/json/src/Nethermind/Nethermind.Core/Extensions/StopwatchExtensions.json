  "summary": "This code defines an extension method for the Stopwatch class in the Nethermind.Core.Extensions namespace. The purpose of this extension method is to provide a way to measure elapsed time in microseconds using a Stopwatch object.\n\nThe ElapsedMicroseconds method takes a Stopwatch object as its parameter and returns the elapsed time in microseconds as a long integer. The method calculates the elapsed time by multiplying the number of elapsed ticks by 1,000,000 and dividing the result by the frequency of the Stopwatch object.\n\nThis extension method can be useful in scenarios where high precision timing is required, such as benchmarking or performance testing. It allows developers to easily measure the execution time of a piece of code in microseconds, which can be more precise than measuring in milliseconds.\n\nHere is an example of how this extension method can be used:\n\n```\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing Nethermind.Core.Extensions;\n\nStopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();\nstopwatch.Start();\n\n// Code to be timed goes here\n\nstopwatch.Stop();\nlong elapsedMicroseconds = stopwatch.ElapsedMicroseconds();\n```\n\nIn this example, a new Stopwatch object is created and started before the code to be timed is executed. After the code has finished executing, the Stopwatch object is stopped and the elapsed time in microseconds is calculated using the ElapsedMicroseconds extension method.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful extension method for measuring elapsed time in microseconds using a Stopwatch object, which can be helpful in performance testing and benchmarking scenarios.",
