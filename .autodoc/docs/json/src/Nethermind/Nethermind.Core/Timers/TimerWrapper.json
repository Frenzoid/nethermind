  "summary": "The `TimerWrapper` class is a wrapper around the `System.Timers.Timer` class that implements the `ITimer` interface. It provides a way to abstract the `System.Timers.Timer` class and make it more testable and mockable. \n\nThe `TimerWrapper` class has a constructor that takes a `System.Timers.Timer` object as a parameter. It subscribes to the `Elapsed` event of the timer object and sets it to call the `OnElapsed` method when the timer elapses. \n\nThe `TimerWrapper` class implements the `ITimer` interface, which defines the properties and methods that a timer should have. The `AutoReset` property gets or sets a value indicating whether the timer should raise the `Elapsed` event each time the interval elapses or only once. The `Enabled` property gets or sets a value indicating whether the timer is enabled. The `Interval` property gets or sets the interval at which to raise the `Elapsed` event. The `IntervalMilliseconds` property gets or sets the interval in milliseconds at which to raise the `Elapsed` event. The `Start` method starts the timer, and the `Stop` method stops the timer. The `Elapsed` event is raised when the timer interval elapses.\n\nThe `Dispose` method unsubscribes from the `Elapsed` event of the timer object and disposes of the timer object.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to create timers that can be easily tested and mocked. For example, if there is a class that needs to use a timer, instead of creating an instance of `System.Timers.Timer` directly, it can create an instance of `TimerWrapper` and pass it to the class. This way, the class can be tested without actually waiting for the timer to elapse. \n\nHere is an example of how the `TimerWrapper` class can be used:\n\n```\nvar timer = new TimerWrapper(new System.Timers.Timer());\ntimer.Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);\ntimer.Elapsed += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine(\"Timer elapsed!\");\ntimer.Start();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a `TimerWrapper` class that implements the `ITimer` interface and wraps a `System.Timers.Timer` instance.\n\n2. What methods and properties are available in the `ITimer` interface?\n   - The `ITimer` interface includes methods for starting and stopping the timer, as well as properties for setting the interval and enabling/disabling auto-reset. It also includes an `Elapsed` event that is raised when the timer interval elapses.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `OnElapsed` method?\n   - The `OnElapsed` method is an event handler that is called when the timer interval elapses. It raises the `Elapsed` event, which can be subscribed to by other code to perform actions when the timer elapses.",
