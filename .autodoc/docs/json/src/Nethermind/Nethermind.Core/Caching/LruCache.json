  "summary": "The `LruCache` class is a generic implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It is used to store key-value pairs in memory with a maximum capacity. When the cache reaches its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is removed to make space for a new item. This is done to optimize memory usage and improve performance by keeping frequently accessed items in memory.\n\nThe `LruCache` class implements the `ICache` interface, which defines methods for getting, setting, and deleting items from the cache. The cache is implemented using a `Dictionary` to store the key-value pairs and a `LinkedList` to keep track of the order in which items were accessed. The `LinkedList` is used to determine which item is the least recently used and should be removed when the cache reaches its maximum capacity.\n\nThe `LruCache` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a maximum capacity, a start capacity, and a name. The second constructor takes a maximum capacity and a name. The start capacity is used to initialize the `Dictionary` with a smaller capacity than the maximum capacity. This is done to avoid allocating memory for the full capacity of the cache when it is created. The name parameter is not used in the implementation of the `LruCache` class, but is included for debugging purposes.\n\nThe `LruCache` class has methods for getting, setting, and deleting items from the cache. The `Get` method takes a key and returns the corresponding value if it exists in the cache. If the key does not exist in the cache, the method returns the default value for the value type. The `TryGet` method is similar to the `Get` method, but returns a boolean indicating whether the key exists in the cache and sets the value parameter to the corresponding value if it does.\n\nThe `Set` method takes a key and a value and adds the key-value pair to the cache. If the key already exists in the cache, the corresponding value is updated and the item is moved to the front of the `LinkedList`. If the cache has reached its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is removed from the cache before the new item is added. The `Delete` method takes a key and removes the corresponding key-value pair from the cache if it exists.\n\nThe `LruCache` class also has methods for checking if a key exists in the cache and converting the cache to an array of key-value pairs. The `MemorySize` property returns the estimated memory usage of the cache in bytes.\n\nOverall, the `LruCache` class is a useful tool for optimizing memory usage and improving performance in applications that require frequent access to key-value pairs. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as caching database queries or storing frequently accessed configuration data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines a class called `LruCache` which implements the `ICache` interface and provides a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism for key-value pairs.\n\n2. What are the input requirements for this code?\n   \n   The `LruCache` class requires two generic type parameters, `TKey` and `TValue`, which represent the types of the keys and values stored in the cache. The `TKey` type must be a non-null reference type. The class also requires an integer `maxCapacity` parameter which specifies the maximum number of items that can be stored in the cache.\n\n3. What is the performance impact of using this code?\n   \n   The `LruCache` class is thread-safe and provides constant-time access to cached items. However, the class uses a linked list to maintain the order of items based on their access time, which can result in increased memory usage and slower performance for large caches. Additionally, the class uses a dictionary to provide constant-time access to cached items by key, which can result in increased memory usage for large caches with many unique keys.",
