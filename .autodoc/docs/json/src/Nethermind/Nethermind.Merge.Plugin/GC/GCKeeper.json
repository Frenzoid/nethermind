  "summary": "The `GCKeeper` class in the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.GC` namespace is responsible for managing garbage collection (GC) in the Nethermind project. The class provides a method `TryStartNoGCRegion` that attempts to start a no GC region, which is a region of memory where garbage collection is not allowed. The method takes an optional `size` parameter that specifies the size of the no GC region. If the `size` parameter is not provided, the default size of 512 MB is used. \n\nThe `TryStartNoGCRegion` method returns an instance of the `NoGCRegion` class, which implements the `IDisposable` interface. The `NoGCRegion` class is responsible for ending the no GC region when it is disposed. If the no GC region was successfully started, the `Dispose` method ends the no GC region and schedules a GC. If the no GC region was not started, the `Dispose` method does nothing.\n\nThe `ScheduleGC` method is responsible for scheduling a GC. The method checks if a GC is already scheduled and if not, it schedules a GC using the `_gcStrategy` object. The `_gcStrategy` object is an instance of the `IGCStrategy` interface, which provides the GC strategy to use. The `ScheduleGC` method uses the `GetForcedGCParams` method of the `_gcStrategy` object to get the GC generation and compaction to use. If the GC generation is greater than `GcLevel.NoGC`, the method waits for 1 second and then forces a GC using the `System.GC.Collect` method.\n\nThe `GCKeeper` class is used in the Nethermind project to manage GC. The class can be used to start a no GC region and schedule a GC. The class can be extended by implementing the `IGCStrategy` interface to provide a custom GC strategy. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nvar gcKeeper = new GCKeeper(new MyGCStrategy(), new MyLogManager());\nusing (gcKeeper.TryStartNoGCRegion())\n{\n    // code that requires no GC\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `GCKeeper` class?\n- The `GCKeeper` class is responsible for managing garbage collection in the application, using a specified garbage collection strategy.\n\n2. Why is the `TryStartNoGCRegion` method using `SustainedLowLatency` instead of `NoGCRegion`?\n- The `TryStartNoGCRegion` method is using `SustainedLowLatency` instead of `NoGCRegion` due to a runtime bug in the .NET framework. The code is left in as comments so it can be reverted when the bug is fixed.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ScheduleGC` method?\n- The `ScheduleGC` method is responsible for scheduling a garbage collection based on the specified garbage collection strategy. It checks if a garbage collection has already been scheduled and if not, it schedules one.",
