  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IAsyncHandler` that is used to handle parameterized JSON RPC requests asynchronously. The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way of handling requests and returning results in the Nethermind project.\n\nThe interface takes two generic type parameters: `TRequest` and `TResult`. `TRequest` represents the type of the request parameters, while `TResult` represents the type of the result that will be returned. The `HandleAsync` method takes a `TRequest` object as input and returns a `Task` of `ResultWrapper<TResult>`.\n\nThe `ResultWrapper` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely used to wrap the result of the request in a standardized way. This could include additional metadata or error handling information.\n\nThis interface is likely used throughout the Nethermind project to handle various types of JSON RPC requests. For example, there may be an implementation of this interface that handles requests related to account balances, and another implementation that handles requests related to transaction history.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a hypothetical implementation:\n\n```\npublic class BalanceHandler : IAsyncHandler<BalanceRequest, BalanceResult>\n{\n    public async Task<ResultWrapper<BalanceResult>> HandleAsync(BalanceRequest request)\n    {\n        // Implementation logic to retrieve balance for specified account\n        BalanceResult result = await GetBalance(request.Account);\n\n        // Wrap result in a ResultWrapper object\n        ResultWrapper<BalanceResult> wrapper = new ResultWrapper<BalanceResult>(result);\n\n        return wrapper;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `BalanceRequest` and `BalanceResult` are custom classes that represent the request parameters and result, respectively, for a JSON RPC request related to account balances. The `HandleAsync` method retrieves the balance for the specified account and wraps the result in a `ResultWrapper` object before returning it.",
