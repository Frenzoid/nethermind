  "summary": "This code defines a custom exception class called `EmptyBlockProductionException` within the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.BlockProduction` namespace. The purpose of this exception is to be thrown when an attempt is made to produce an empty block.\n\nThe constructor for this exception takes a string message as input and passes it to the base constructor of the `System.Exception` class. The message is formatted to include the original message passed to the constructor, indicating that an empty block could not be produced.\n\nThis exception class may be used in the larger project to handle cases where an empty block is not a valid output. For example, if a block producer is attempting to create a new block but is unable to include any transactions, it may throw an instance of this exception to indicate that an empty block cannot be produced.\n\nCode example:\n\n```\ntry\n{\n    // attempt to produce a new block\n}\ncatch (EmptyBlockProductionException ex)\n{\n    // handle the exception\n}\n```",
