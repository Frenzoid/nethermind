  "summary": "This code defines a C# class called `AccountLockedEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. The purpose of this class is to provide an event argument for when an account is locked in the Nethermind wallet. \n\nThe `AccountLockedEventArgs` class has a single property called `Address` which is of type `Address`. This property is read-only and can be accessed from outside the class. The `Address` property represents the address of the account that was locked.\n\nThe constructor of the `AccountLockedEventArgs` class takes an `Address` parameter and assigns it to the `Address` property. This constructor is used to create a new instance of the `AccountLockedEventArgs` class with the address of the locked account.\n\nThis class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Nethermind wallet to handle events related to account locking. For example, a method in the wallet may raise an event of type `AccountLockedEventArgs` when an account is locked, and other methods or classes may subscribe to this event to perform additional actions.\n\nHere is an example of how this class may be used:\n\n```\npublic class Wallet\n{\n    public event EventHandler<AccountLockedEventArgs> AccountLocked;\n\n    public void LockAccount(Address address)\n    {\n        // perform account locking logic\n        AccountLocked?.Invoke(this, new AccountLockedEventArgs(address));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Wallet` class has an event called `AccountLocked` of type `EventHandler<AccountLockedEventArgs>`. The `LockAccount` method is responsible for locking an account and raising the `AccountLocked` event with the address of the locked account. Other classes or methods can subscribe to this event to perform additional actions when an account is locked.",
