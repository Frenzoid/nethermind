  "summary": "The `DevWallet` class is a wallet implementation that is intended for development purposes only. It is not recommended to use this wallet in a production environment. The purpose of this wallet is to provide a simple way to generate and manage accounts for testing and development purposes.\n\nThe `DevWallet` class implements the `IWallet` interface, which defines a set of methods for managing accounts. The `DevWallet` class provides implementations for these methods, including `GetAccounts`, `NewAccount`, `UnlockAccount`, `LockAccount`, `Sign`, and `Import`.\n\nThe `DevWallet` class generates private keys for accounts using a `PrivateKeyGenerator`. The private keys are stored in a dictionary, along with a password for each account. The passwords are stored in a separate dictionary, which is used to check the password when unlocking an account or signing a message.\n\nThe `DevWallet` class provides events for when an account is locked or unlocked. These events can be used to trigger actions when an account is locked or unlocked.\n\nThe `DevWallet` class also provides a method for signing a message using the `Secp256k1` elliptic curve cryptography library. The `Sign` method takes a `Keccak` message and an `Address` as input, and returns a `Signature`. The `Sign` method first checks if the account is unlocked, and if not, it checks the password. If the account is unlocked or the password is correct, the `Sign` method signs the message using the private key associated with the account.\n\nOverall, the `DevWallet` class provides a simple way to generate and manage accounts for testing and development purposes. It is not intended for use in a production environment, as it does not provide the same level of security as a production wallet implementation.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DevWallet` class?\n    \n    The `DevWallet` class is a wallet implementation for development purposes only, and should not be used in a secured context.\n\n2. How are new accounts generated in the `DevWallet` class?\n    \n    New accounts are generated using a `PrivateKeyGenerator` instance, and the resulting private key is added to the `_keys` dictionary along with an associated password and unlocked status.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Sign` method in the `DevWallet` class?\n    \n    The `Sign` method is used to sign a `Keccak` message with the private key associated with a given address. If the account is locked, the method will attempt to unlock it using the provided passphrase.",
