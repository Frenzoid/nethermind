  "summary": "This code defines an enum called `SendBlockMode` within the `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace. The purpose of this enum is to provide two options for how a block should be sent within the blockchain system. \n\nThe first option is `FullBlock`, which indicates that the entire block should be sent. This means that all of the transactions within the block will be included in the message that is sent. \n\nThe second option is `HashOnly`, which indicates that only the hash of the block should be sent. This means that the message will only include the unique identifier for the block, rather than all of the transaction data. \n\nThis enum is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project where blocks need to be sent or received. For example, it may be used in a method that sends a block to another node in the blockchain network. The method could take a `SendBlockMode` parameter to determine whether the full block or just the hash should be sent. \n\nHere is an example of how this enum could be used in a method:\n\n```\npublic void SendBlock(Block block, SendBlockMode sendMode)\n{\n    if (sendMode == SendBlockMode.FullBlock)\n    {\n        // send the full block\n    }\n    else if (sendMode == SendBlockMode.HashOnly)\n    {\n        // send only the block hash\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple but important feature for sending and receiving blocks within the Nethermind blockchain system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SendBlockMode` enum?\n   - The `SendBlockMode` enum is used to specify whether a full block or just the block hash should be sent.\n2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?\n   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released and is used to ensure license compliance.\n3. What is the namespace `Nethermind.Blockchain` used for?\n   - The `Nethermind.Blockchain` namespace is used to group related classes and interfaces that are part of the blockchain functionality in the Nethermind project.",
