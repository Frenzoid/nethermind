  "summary": "The `CompositePruningTrigger` class is a part of the Nethermind blockchain project and is used to allow multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to monitor multiple triggers for pruning events and invoke the `Prune` event when any of the triggers are pruned.\n\nThe `CompositePruningTrigger` class implements the `IPruningTrigger` interface, which defines a `Prune` event that is raised when a pruning trigger is triggered. The `Add` method is used to add a new `IPruningTrigger` to the list of triggers that are being watched. When a pruning event is raised by any of the triggers, the `OnPrune` method is called, which in turn invokes the `Prune` event.\n\nThis class is useful in scenarios where multiple triggers need to be monitored for pruning events. For example, in a blockchain system, there may be multiple triggers that can cause pruning of old blocks, such as a change in consensus rules or a change in the block size limit. By using the `CompositePruningTrigger` class, all of these triggers can be monitored and handled in a single place.\n\nHere is an example of how the `CompositePruningTrigger` class can be used:\n\n```\nvar compositeTrigger = new CompositePruningTrigger();\nvar trigger1 = new ConsensusPruningTrigger();\nvar trigger2 = new BlockSizePruningTrigger();\n\ncompositeTrigger.Add(trigger1);\ncompositeTrigger.Add(trigger2);\n\ncompositeTrigger.Prune += (sender, args) =>\n{\n    // Handle pruning event\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, two triggers (`ConsensusPruningTrigger` and `BlockSizePruningTrigger`) are added to the `CompositePruningTrigger` instance. When either of these triggers is pruned, the `Prune` event of the `CompositePruningTrigger` is raised, which can be handled by the code that subscribes to the event.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `CompositePruningTrigger` that allows for multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched.\n\n2. What is the `IPruningTrigger` interface?\n- The `IPruningTrigger` interface is not defined in this code, but it is referenced as a type that can be added to the `CompositePruningTrigger` class.\n\n3. What is the `OnPrune` method used for?\n- The `OnPrune` method is a private method that is called when a `Prune` event is triggered by one of the watched `IPruningTrigger`s. It then invokes the `Prune` event for the `CompositePruningTrigger` object.",
