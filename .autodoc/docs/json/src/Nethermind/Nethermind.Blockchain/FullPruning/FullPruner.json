  "summary": "The `FullPruner` class is a main orchestrator of Full Pruning in the Nethermind project. Full pruning is a process of removing old and unused data from the blockchain database to reduce its size and improve performance. This class is responsible for starting and managing the full pruning process.\n\nThe `FullPruner` class implements the `IDisposable` interface, which means that it can be used in a `using` statement to ensure that all resources are properly disposed of when the process is finished.\n\nThe class has several private fields, including instances of `IFullPruningDb`, `IPruningTrigger`, `IPruningConfig`, `IBlockTree`, `IStateReader`, `ILogManager`, and `ILogger`. These fields are used to manage the full pruning process.\n\nThe `OnPrune` method is called when the pruning trigger is activated. It checks if the minimum pruning delay has passed and if a new pruning process can be started. If a new pruning process can be started, it sets a flag to wait for the block to be processed and starts the pruning process.\n\nThe `OnUpdateMainChain` method is called when the main chain is updated. It checks if the block has been processed and if a new pruning process can be started. If a new pruning process can be started, it sets a flag to wait for the state to be ready and starts the pruning process.\n\nThe `SetCurrentPruning` method sets the current pruning context and disposes of the old pruning context.\n\nThe `RunPruning` method runs the pruning process. It creates a `CopyTreeVisitor` instance and runs it on the state root. It then commits the changes to the database and disposes of the pruning context.\n\nThe `Dispose` method disposes of all resources used by the `FullPruner` class.\n\nOverall, the `FullPruner` class is an important part of the Nethermind project, responsible for managing the full pruning process to optimize the performance and size of the blockchain database.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code is the main orchestrator of Full Pruning in the Nethermind blockchain project. It handles the logic for starting and running full pruning.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n    \n    This code has dependencies on several other modules in the Nethermind project, including `Nethermind.Core`, `Nethermind.Db`, `Nethermind.Logging`, and `Nethermind.State`. It also uses the `System` and `System.Threading` namespaces.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `OnUpdateMainChain` method?\n    \n    The `OnUpdateMainChain` method is called when the main chain is updated with new blocks. It is used to determine when it is safe to start full pruning, and to handle the logic for actually running the pruning process.",
