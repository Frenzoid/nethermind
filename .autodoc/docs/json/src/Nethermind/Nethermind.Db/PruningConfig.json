  "summary": "The `PruningConfig` class is a configuration object that is used to specify the pruning settings for the Nethermind database. Pruning is the process of removing old data from the database to reduce its size and improve performance. The `PruningConfig` class provides a number of properties that can be used to configure the pruning behavior.\n\nThe `Enabled` property is a boolean value that indicates whether pruning is enabled or not. If pruning is enabled, the `Mode` property specifies the pruning mode to use. The `Mode` property is an enum value that can be set to one of three values: `Memory`, `Archive`, or `Hybrid`. The `Memory` mode keeps only the most recent data in memory, while the `Archive` mode keeps all data on disk. The `Hybrid` mode is a combination of the two, where recent data is kept in memory and older data is moved to disk.\n\nThe `CacheMb` property specifies the size of the cache in megabytes. The `PersistenceInterval` property specifies the number of blocks between persistence operations. The `FullPruningThresholdMb` property specifies the size of the database in megabytes at which point full pruning should be triggered. The `FullPruningTrigger` property specifies the trigger for full pruning, which can be either `Manual` or `Automatic`. The `FullPruningMaxDegreeOfParallelism` property specifies the maximum degree of parallelism to use during full pruning. The `FullPruningMemoryBudgetMb` property specifies the memory budget to use during full pruning. The `FullPruningMinimumDelayHours` property specifies the minimum delay in hours before full pruning can be triggered again. The `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property specifies the behavior to use when full pruning is complete.\n\nOverall, the `PruningConfig` class provides a flexible and configurable way to specify the pruning behavior for the Nethermind database. It can be used in conjunction with other classes and components in the Nethermind project to provide a robust and efficient database solution. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\nPruningConfig config = new PruningConfig();\nconfig.Enabled = true;\nconfig.Mode = PruningMode.Hybrid;\nconfig.CacheMb = 2048;\nconfig.PersistenceInterval = 16384;\nconfig.FullPruningThresholdMb = 512000;\nconfig.FullPruningTrigger = FullPruningTrigger.Automatic;\nconfig.FullPruningMaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4;\nconfig.FullPruningMemoryBudgetMb = 1024;\nconfig.FullPruningMinimumDelayHours = 480;\nconfig.FullPruningCompletionBehavior = FullPruningCompletionBehavior.Delete;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PruningConfig` class?\n    \n    The `PruningConfig` class is used to configure pruning settings for a database.\n\n2. What is the default value for the `Mode` property?\n    \n    The default value for the `Mode` property is `PruningMode.Hybrid`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property?\n    \n    The `FullPruningCompletionBehavior` property is used to specify the behavior of the system after a full pruning operation is completed.",
