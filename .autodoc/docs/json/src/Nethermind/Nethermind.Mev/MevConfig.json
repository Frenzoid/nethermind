  "summary": "The code defines a class called `MevConfig` that implements the `IMevConfig` interface. This class is used to store configuration settings related to MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) in the Nethermind project. MEV refers to the amount of value that can be extracted from a given transaction or block by a miner or validator through various means such as reordering transactions, including or excluding transactions, etc.\n\nThe `MevConfig` class has several properties that can be used to configure MEV-related settings. The `Enabled` property is a boolean that indicates whether MEV is enabled or not. The `BundleHorizon` property is a `UInt256` value that represents the time horizon (in seconds) for MEV bundle inclusion. The `BundlePoolSize` property is an integer that represents the maximum number of bundles that can be included in a block. The `MaxMergedBundles` property is an integer that represents the maximum number of bundles that can be merged together. Finally, the `TrustedRelays` property is a string that represents a list of trusted relays that can be used for MEV extraction.\n\nThe `MevConfig` class also defines a static `Default` property that returns an instance of the `MevConfig` class with default values for all properties. This can be used as a fallback configuration if no other configuration is provided.\n\nOverall, the `MevConfig` class provides a way to configure MEV-related settings in the Nethermind project. It can be used by other classes and modules in the project to access and modify these settings as needed. For example, a module that is responsible for MEV extraction might use the `MevConfig` class to determine the maximum number of bundles that can be included in a block or the time horizon for bundle inclusion.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines a class called `MevConfig` which implements an interface `IMevConfig` and contains properties related to MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) configuration.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Default` static field?\n   - The `Default` static field is an instance of the `MevConfig` class with default property values. It can be used as a default configuration for MEV-related functionality.\n\n3. What is the meaning of the `BundleHorizon` property?\n   - The `BundleHorizon` property is of type `UInt256` and represents the time horizon (in seconds) for MEV bundle inclusion. By default, it is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).",
