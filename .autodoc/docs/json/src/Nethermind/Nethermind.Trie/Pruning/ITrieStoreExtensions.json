  "summary": "This code defines an extension method for the `ITrieStore` interface in the `Nethermind.Trie.Pruning` namespace. The purpose of this extension method is to provide a way to create a read-only version of a `ITrieStore` instance.\n\nThe `AsReadOnly` method takes an `ITrieStore` instance as its first argument and an optional `IKeyValueStore` instance as its second argument. The `ITrieStore` instance is the one that will be converted to a read-only version, while the `IKeyValueStore` instance is used to store the read-only version of the trie. If the `IKeyValueStore` instance is not provided, a default one will be used.\n\nThe `AsReadOnly` method returns an `IReadOnlyTrieStore` instance, which is a read-only version of the original `ITrieStore` instance. This read-only version can be used to retrieve data from the trie, but it cannot be modified.\n\nThis extension method can be useful in situations where you want to provide read-only access to a trie, but you don't want to expose the original `ITrieStore` instance. For example, you might want to provide read-only access to a trie to a client application, but you don't want the client to be able to modify the trie.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `AsReadOnly` extension method:\n\n```csharp\nusing Nethermind.Trie.Pruning;\n\n// create an instance of ITrieStore\nITrieStore trieStore = new MyTrieStore();\n\n// create a read-only version of the trie store\nIReadOnlyTrieStore readOnlyTrieStore = trieStore.AsReadOnly();\n\n// use the read-only version of the trie store to retrieve data\nbyte[] value = readOnlyTrieStore.Get(\"key\");\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n    - This code file contains an extension method for `ITrieStore` interface to convert it to a read-only version.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?\n    - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, it is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.\n\n3. Why is the `IKeyValueStore` parameter nullable in the `AsReadOnly` method?\n    - The `IKeyValueStore` parameter is nullable in the `AsReadOnly` method to allow for the possibility of not providing a read-only store. If no read-only store is provided, the method will create a new one.",
