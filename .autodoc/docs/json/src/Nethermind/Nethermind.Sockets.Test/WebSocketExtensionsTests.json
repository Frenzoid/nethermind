  "summary": "The `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class contains a set of unit tests for testing the functionality of the `SocketClient` class, which is used for handling WebSocket connections. The tests cover various scenarios such as receiving messages of different sizes, handling dirty disconnects, and updating metrics and stats.\n\nThe `WebSocketMock` class is a mock implementation of the `WebSocket` class used for testing purposes. It overrides the `ReceiveAsync` method to simulate receiving messages of different sizes and types. It also implements other methods required by the `WebSocket` class.\n\nThe `Can_receive_whole_message` test checks if the `SocketClient` can receive a message that is split into multiple parts and reassemble it correctly. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate receiving a message in three parts. It then creates a `SocketClient` instance and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the `ProcessAsync` method of the `SocketClient` instance is called with the correct message size.\n\nThe `Updates_Metrics_And_Stats_Successfully` test checks if the `SocketClient` updates the metrics and stats correctly when processing a message. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate receiving a message. It also creates a mock implementation of the `IJsonRpcProcessor`, `IJsonRpcService`, and `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interfaces. It then creates a `JsonRpcSocketsClient` instance with these objects and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the metrics and stats are updated correctly.\n\nThe `Can_receive_many_messages` test checks if the `SocketClient` can receive multiple messages correctly. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate receiving 1000 messages. It then creates a `SocketClient` instance and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the `ProcessAsync` method of the `SocketClient` instance is called 1000 times with the correct message size.\n\nThe `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` test checks if the `SocketClient` can receive a message that is split into multiple parts of non-buffer sizes and reassemble it correctly. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate receiving a message in six parts. It then creates a `SocketClient` instance and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the `ProcessAsync` method of the `SocketClient` instance is called with the correct message size.\n\nThe `Throws_on_too_long_message` test checks if the `SocketClient` throws an exception when receiving a message that is too long. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate receiving a message that is split into 1024 parts, each with a size of 5 * 1024 bytes. It then creates a `SocketClient` instance and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the `ProcessAsync` method of the `SocketClient` instance is not called and if an exception is thrown.\n\nThe `Stops_on_dirty_disconnect` test checks if the `SocketClient` stops when a dirty disconnect occurs. It creates a `WebSocketMock` instance with a queue of `WebSocketReceiveResult` objects that simulate a dirty disconnect. It then creates a `SocketClient` instance and calls its `ReceiveAsync` method. Finally, it checks if the method returns without throwing an exception.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class?\n- The `WebSocketExtensionsTests` class is a test class that contains several test methods for testing the behavior of the `SocketClient` class when receiving WebSocket messages.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `WebSocketMock` class?\n- The `WebSocketMock` class is a mock implementation of the `WebSocket` class that is used in the tests to simulate receiving WebSocket messages.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` test method?\n- The `Can_receive_whole_message_non_buffer_sizes` test method tests whether the `SocketClient` class can correctly receive and process a WebSocket message that is composed of multiple frames with non-standard buffer sizes.",
