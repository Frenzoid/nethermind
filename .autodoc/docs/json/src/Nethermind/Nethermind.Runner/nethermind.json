  "summary": "This code defines a set of CSS variables that can be used throughout the nethermind project to maintain a consistent visual style. \n\nThe `:root` selector is used to define the variables at the highest level of the document tree, making them available to all elements within the project. \n\nThe `--primaryColor` variable is set to a light gray color, while `--secondaryColor` is set to a bright orange. These colors can be used to create a visual hierarchy within the project, with the primary color being used for less important elements and the secondary color being used for more important elements. \n\nThe `--bgMenuActive` variable is set to a bright blue color, which can be used to indicate when a menu item is currently active. \n\nThe `--bgButton` variable is set to the same bright orange color as `--secondaryColor`, which can be used to create a consistent style for buttons throughout the project. \n\nThe `--logoImageUrl` variable is set to the URL of the nethermind project's logo image, which can be used to display the logo throughout the project. \n\nFinally, the `--bgAside` variable is set to the same light gray color as `--primaryColor`, which can be used to create a consistent background color for sidebars or other secondary content areas throughout the project. \n\nOverall, this code helps to maintain a consistent visual style throughout the nethermind project by defining a set of reusable CSS variables. These variables can be used in conjunction with other CSS styles to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```css\n.navbar {\n  background-color: var(--primaryColor);\n}\n\n.active-menu-item {\n  background-color: var(--bgMenuActive);\n}\n\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--bgButton);\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.logo {\n  background-image: var(--logoImageUrl);\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n  background-color: var(--bgAside);\n}\n```",
