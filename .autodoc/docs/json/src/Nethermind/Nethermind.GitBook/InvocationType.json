  "summary": "This code defines an enumeration called `InvocationType` within the `Nethermind.GitBook` namespace. The `InvocationType` enumeration has three possible values: `JsonRpc`, `Cli`, and `Both`. \n\nThis enumeration is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project to specify the type of invocation that should be used for a particular operation. For example, if a user wants to interact with the Nethermind software via the command line interface (CLI), they would specify `InvocationType.Cli`. If they want to interact with the software via the JSON-RPC API, they would specify `InvocationType.JsonRpc`. If they want to be able to use both methods of invocation, they would specify `InvocationType.Both`.\n\nHere is an example of how this enumeration might be used in code:\n\n```\nusing Nethermind.GitBook;\n\npublic class MyNethermindClass\n{\n    public void DoSomething(InvocationType invocationType)\n    {\n        if (invocationType == InvocationType.Cli)\n        {\n            // Do something via the CLI\n        }\n        else if (invocationType == InvocationType.JsonRpc)\n        {\n            // Do something via the JSON-RPC API\n        }\n        else if (invocationType == InvocationType.Both)\n        {\n            // Do something via both the CLI and JSON-RPC API\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to specify the type of invocation that should be used for a particular operation within the Nethermind project.",
