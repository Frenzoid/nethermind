  "summary": "The `.autodoc/docs/json/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.GitBook/envs` folder contains files and subfolders related to the environment configuration of the Nethermind project. \n\nThe `envs` folder contains subfolders for different environments, such as `mainnet`, `ropsten`, and `rinkeby`. Each of these subfolders contains a `config.json` file, which specifies the configuration settings for that particular environment. These settings include things like network ID, bootnodes, and gas prices.\n\nThe `envs` folder also contains a `default.json` file, which specifies the default configuration settings that are used if no specific environment is specified. This file is used as a fallback if a specific environment configuration is not found.\n\nThe `envs` folder is used by other parts of the Nethermind project to determine the appropriate configuration settings for the current environment. For example, the `Nethermind.Runner` project uses the `envs` folder to determine the appropriate configuration settings for the current network.\n\nDevelopers can use the `envs` folder to customize the configuration settings for their particular use case. For example, if a developer wants to run a private Ethereum network, they can create a new subfolder in the `envs` folder and specify their own configuration settings in a `config.json` file.\n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use the `envs` folder to specify custom configuration settings:\n\n```\n{\n  \"NetworkId\": 1337,\n  \"Bootnodes\": [\n    \"enode://0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef@127.0.0.1:30303\"\n  ],\n  \"GasPrice\": 1000000000\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer has specified a custom network ID of 1337, a single bootnode running on localhost, and a gas price of 1 Gwei.\n\nOverall, the `envs` folder is an important part of the Nethermind project that allows developers to easily customize the configuration settings for their particular use case.",
