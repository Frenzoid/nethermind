  "summary": "This code defines two event classes, `SortedPoolEventArgs` and `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs`, and declares two events, `Inserted` and `Removed`, within the `SortedPool` class. The purpose of these events is to allow other parts of the `Nethermind` project to subscribe to notifications when items are added to or removed from a sorted pool.\n\nThe `SortedPoolEventArgs` class contains three properties: `Key`, `Value`, and `Group`. These properties represent the key, value, and group of the item that was added to the pool. The `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` class inherits from `SortedPoolEventArgs` and adds a `bool` property `Evicted` to indicate whether the item was removed due to eviction.\n\nThe `Inserted` event is raised when a new item is added to the pool, and the `Removed` event is raised when an item is removed from the pool. Other parts of the `Nethermind` project can subscribe to these events to perform additional actions when items are added to or removed from the pool. For example, a module that tracks transaction status could subscribe to the `Removed` event to update its internal state when a transaction is removed from the pool.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Inserted` event could be used:\n\n```\nvar pool = new SortedPool<int, string, char>();\npool.Inserted += (sender, args) =>\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Added item with key {args.Key}, value {args.Value}, and group {args.Group}\");\n};\npool.Add(1, \"foo\", 'A');\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `SortedPool` is created with integer keys, string values, and character groups. A lambda expression is then attached to the `Inserted` event that simply writes the details of the added item to the console. Finally, an item with key `1`, value `\"foo\"`, and group `'A'` is added to the pool, which triggers the lambda expression to execute and print the details of the added item to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SortedPool` class and what are the generic type parameters `TKey`, `TValue`, and `TGroupKey` used for?\n   - The `SortedPool` class is a collection class in the `Nethermind.TxPool.Collections` namespace. It is generic and takes three type parameters: `TKey` is the type of the keys, `TValue` is the type of the values, and `TGroupKey` is the type of the group keys.\n2. What do the `Inserted` and `Removed` events do and when are they raised?\n   - The `Inserted` event is raised when a new item is added to the `SortedPool` collection. The `Removed` event is raised when an item is removed from the collection. Both events are defined as `public` and take event arguments of different types.\n3. What is the purpose of the `SortedPoolEventArgs` and `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` classes and what information do they contain?\n   - The `SortedPoolEventArgs` class contains information about an item that was inserted into the `SortedPool` collection, including the key, value, and group key. The `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` class inherits from `SortedPoolEventArgs` and adds a `bool` property `Evicted` to indicate whether the item was removed due to eviction.",
