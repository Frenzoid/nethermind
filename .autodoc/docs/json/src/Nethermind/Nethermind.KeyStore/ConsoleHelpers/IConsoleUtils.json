  "summary": "This code defines an interface called `IConsoleUtils` within the `Nethermind.KeyStore.ConsoleHelpers` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide a method for reading a secret from the console input in a secure manner. \n\nThe `ReadSecret` method takes a single parameter, `secretDisplayName`, which is a string that represents the name or description of the secret being read. The method returns a `SecureString` object, which is a string that is encrypted and can be securely stored in memory. This is useful for storing sensitive information such as passwords or private keys.\n\nThis interface is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project where secure input is required, such as when creating or unlocking a keystore file. By using a `SecureString` object, the sensitive information can be protected from being easily accessed by malicious actors.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a hypothetical scenario:\n\n```csharp\nusing Nethermind.KeyStore.ConsoleHelpers;\n\npublic class KeystoreManager\n{\n    private readonly IConsoleUtils _consoleUtils;\n\n    public KeystoreManager(IConsoleUtils consoleUtils)\n    {\n        _consoleUtils = consoleUtils;\n    }\n\n    public void CreateKeystore()\n    {\n        // Prompt user for password\n        SecureString password = _consoleUtils.ReadSecret(\"Enter password:\");\n\n        // Create keystore file using password\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `KeystoreManager` class takes an instance of `IConsoleUtils` as a constructor parameter. When the `CreateKeystore` method is called, the `ReadSecret` method is used to securely read the user's password from the console input. This password is then used to create a keystore file.",
