  "summary": "The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is a generic class that extends the `ContractDataStore` class. It is used to store contract data with local data. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store contract data in a local data source, in addition to the main data store. This allows for faster access to frequently used data, as well as the ability to work offline.\n\nThe class takes in several parameters in its constructor, including a `IContractDataStoreCollection<T>` object, which is the main data store, a `IDataContract<T>` object, which is used to serialize and deserialize the data, an `IBlockTree` object, which is used to track the blockchain, an `IReceiptFinder` object, which is used to find receipts, an `ILogManager` object, which is used for logging, and an `ILocalDataSource<IEnumerable<T>>` object, which is the local data source.\n\nThe class has an event called `Loaded`, which is raised when the local data is loaded. The `OnChanged` method is called when the local data source is changed. This method loads the local data, removes the old data from the main data store, inserts the new data into the main data store, and raises the `Loaded` event.\n\nThe `LoadLocalData` method loads the local data from the local data source, removes the old data from the main data store, inserts the new data into the main data store, and logs the changes.\n\nThe `RemoveOldContractItemsFromCollection` method removes old contract items from the main data store and inserts the local data into the main data store.\n\nThe `Dispose` method disposes of the object and removes the event handler for the `Changed` event.\n\nOverall, the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class provides a way to store contract data in a local data source, in addition to the main data store. This allows for faster access to frequently used data, as well as the ability to work offline.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class?\n- The `ContractDataStoreWithLocalData` class is a subclass of `ContractDataStore` that adds support for local data storage and retrieval.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Loaded` event?\n- The `Loaded` event is raised when local data is loaded into the contract data store, indicating that the data is now available for use.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `RemoveOldContractItemsFromCollection` method?\n- The `RemoveOldContractItemsFromCollection` method removes old contract items from the collection and inserts the local data into the collection.",
