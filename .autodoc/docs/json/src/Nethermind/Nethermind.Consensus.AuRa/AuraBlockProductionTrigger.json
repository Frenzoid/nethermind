  "summary": "The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class is a subclass of `BuildBlocksInALoop` and is used in the Nethermind project to build blocks in a loop for the AuRa consensus algorithm. The class takes an `IAuRaStepCalculator` object, which is used to calculate the time to the next step in the consensus algorithm. The `ILogManager` object is used for logging purposes. The `autoStart` parameter is used to determine whether the loop should start automatically upon instantiation.\n\nThe `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class overrides the `ProducerLoopStep` method of the `BuildBlocksInALoop` class. The `ProducerLoopStep` method is called in a loop to produce blocks. The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class adds additional functionality to the `ProducerLoopStep` method to ensure that blocks are produced at the correct time according to the AuRa consensus algorithm.\n\nThe `ProducerLoopStep` method first creates a `CancellationTokenSource` object to be able to cancel the current step block production if needed. It then calculates the time to the next step in the consensus algorithm using the `_auRaStepCalculator` object. The `TaskExt.DelayAtLeast` method is used to delay the loop until the next step. The `base.ProducerLoopStep` method is then called to try to produce a block in the current step. If the block production is not completed by the time the next step is reached, the `stepTokenSource.Cancel()` method is called to cancel the block production.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Nethermind project to ensure that blocks are produced at the correct time according to the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is used in conjunction with other classes and methods to implement the AuRa consensus algorithm in the Nethermind project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nIAuRaStepCalculator auRaStepCalculator = new AuRaStepCalculator();\nILogManager logManager = new LogManager();\nBuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps buildBlocksOnAuRaSteps = new BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps(auRaStepCalculator, logManager);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class and how does it relate to the `BuildBlocksInALoop` class?\n   \n   The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class is a subclass of `BuildBlocksInALoop` and is used to build blocks in a loop according to the AuRa consensus algorithm. It overrides the `ProducerLoopStep` method to add functionality specific to AuRa, such as waiting for the next AuRa step and cancelling block production if needed.\n\n2. What is the `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface is used to calculate the time until the next AuRa step. In this code, the `timeToNextStep` variable is set to the result of calling the `TimeToNextStep` property of the `_auRaStepCalculator` instance. This value is then used to delay block production until the next step.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `autoStart` parameter in the constructor of `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps`?\n   \n   The `autoStart` parameter is used to determine whether the block production loop should start automatically when an instance of `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` is created. If `autoStart` is `true`, the `StartLoop` method is called to start the loop. If `autoStart` is `false`, the loop must be started manually by calling the `StartLoop` method.",
