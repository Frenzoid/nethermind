  "summary": "The code defines an abstract class called `CliModuleBase` that serves as a base class for other command-line interface (CLI) modules in the Nethermind project. The class contains two protected properties: `Engine` and `NodeManager`, both of which are interfaces that are passed in as constructor arguments. \n\nThe class also contains two static methods: `CliParseAddress` and `CliParseHash`. These methods take a string argument and attempt to parse it as an `Address` or `Keccak` object, respectively. If the parsing is successful, the method returns the parsed object. If the parsing fails, the method throws a `CliArgumentParserException` with an appropriate error message.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a common interface for other CLI modules to interact with the Nethermind engine and node manager. By inheriting from this base class, other modules can access these properties and use them to perform various tasks. The `CliParseAddress` and `CliParseHash` methods are utility methods that can be used by other modules to parse user input and ensure that it is in the correct format.\n\nHere is an example of how another module might inherit from `CliModuleBase` and use the `Engine` and `NodeManager` properties:\n\n```\nusing Nethermind.Cli.Modules;\n\nnamespace Nethermind.Cli.Modules.Example\n{\n    public class ExampleModule : CliModuleBase\n    {\n        public ExampleModule(ICliEngine engine, INodeManager nodeManager) : base(engine, nodeManager)\n        {\n        }\n\n        public void DoSomething()\n        {\n            // Use the Engine and NodeManager properties to perform some task\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ExampleModule` class inherits from `CliModuleBase` and passes the `engine` and `nodeManager` objects to the base constructor. The `DoSomething` method can then use the `Engine` and `NodeManager` properties to perform some task, such as retrieving information about the current state of the blockchain.",
