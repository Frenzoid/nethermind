  "summary": "The `AccessListItemForRpc` class is a data class that represents an access list item in the JSON-RPC format. An access list is a list of addresses and storage keys that are allowed to access a contract's storage during a transaction. This class provides methods to convert an `AccessList` object to an array of `AccessListItemForRpc` objects and vice versa.\n\nThe `AccessListItemForRpc` class has two properties: `Address` and `StorageKeys`. The `Address` property is an `Address` object that represents the address of an account that is allowed to access the contract's storage. The `StorageKeys` property is an array of `UInt256` objects that represent the storage keys that the account is allowed to access. If the account is not allowed to access any storage keys, the `StorageKeys` property is set to an empty array.\n\nThe `FromAccessList` method is a static method that takes an `AccessList` object as input and returns an array of `AccessListItemForRpc` objects. This method is used to convert an `AccessList` object to an array of `AccessListItemForRpc` objects that can be serialized to JSON and sent over the network in a JSON-RPC request.\n\nThe `ToAccessList` method is a static method that takes an array of `AccessListItemForRpc` objects as input and returns an `AccessList` object. This method is used to convert an array of `AccessListItemForRpc` objects received in a JSON-RPC request to an `AccessList` object that can be used by the EVM during transaction execution.\n\nOverall, the `AccessListItemForRpc` class provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize access lists in the JSON-RPC format. It is used by other classes in the `Nethermind` project that deal with JSON-RPC requests and responses. For example, the `EthEstimateGasHandler` class uses this class to parse the `accessList` parameter in an `eth_estimateGas` request.",
