  "summary": "The `JsonRpcLocalStats` class is responsible for collecting and reporting statistics related to JSON-RPC calls made to a local node. It implements the `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface and provides methods for reporting call statistics and retrieving method statistics.\n\nThe class maintains three dictionaries to store the statistics: `_currentStats`, `_previousStats`, and `_allTimeStats`. `_currentStats` stores the statistics for the current reporting interval, `_previousStats` stores the statistics for the previous reporting interval, and `_allTimeStats` stores the statistics for all calls made to the node.\n\nThe class provides a `ReportCall` method that takes an `RpcReport` object and updates the statistics accordingly. The `RpcReport` object contains information about the method name, handling time, and success status of the call. The method also takes optional parameters for elapsed time and size of the response.\n\nThe class provides a `GetMethodStats` method that takes a method name and returns the statistics for that method from `_allTimeStats`.\n\nThe class periodically reports the statistics using the `BuildReport` method. The reporting interval is determined by the `ReportIntervalSeconds` property of the `IJsonRpcConfig` object passed to the constructor. The method generates a report string and logs it using the `ILogger` object passed to the constructor.\n\nThe class also provides a `PrepareReportLine` method that formats a single line of the report string for a given method and its statistics.\n\nOverall, the `JsonRpcLocalStats` class provides a way to monitor the performance of JSON-RPC calls made to a local node and identify any issues that may arise. It can be used in conjunction with other monitoring tools to gain insights into the performance of the node and optimize its configuration.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `JsonRpcLocalStats` that implements the `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface. It provides methods for reporting and retrieving statistics related to JSON-RPC method calls.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind.Core`, `Nethermind.Logging`, and `Nethermind.JsonRpc` namespaces. It also uses the `System` namespace.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BuildReport` method?\n- The `BuildReport` method is called periodically to generate a report of the JSON-RPC method call statistics collected so far. It formats the report as a string and logs it using the `ILogger` instance provided during initialization.",
