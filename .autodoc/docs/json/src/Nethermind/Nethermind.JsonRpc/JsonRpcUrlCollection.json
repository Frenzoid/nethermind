  "summary": "The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is a collection of `JsonRpcUrl` objects that represent the URLs for JSON-RPC endpoints. This class extends the `Dictionary<int, JsonRpcUrl>` class and implements the `IJsonRpcUrlCollection` interface. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to build a collection of JSON-RPC URLs based on the configuration settings provided. The constructor takes in a `ILogManager` object, an `IJsonRpcConfig` object, and a boolean value that indicates whether to include web sockets. If JSON-RPC is enabled, the `BuildUrls` method is called to build the default URL and add it to the collection. If the `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable is set, the default URL is updated with the values from the environment variable. \n\nIf web sockets are enabled, the default URL is cloned and a new URL is created with the web sockets port. The `BuildEngineUrls` method is called to build the URL for the execution engine if it is enabled. The `BuildAdditionalUrls` method is called to build any additional URLs specified in the configuration settings. \n\nThe `Urls` property returns an array of strings that represent the URLs in the collection. \n\nThis class is used in the larger project to manage the JSON-RPC endpoints. It provides a way to build and manage the URLs for the various JSON-RPC endpoints based on the configuration settings. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\nvar logManager = new LogManager();\nvar jsonRpcConfig = new JsonRpcConfig();\nvar includeWebSockets = true;\nvar jsonRpcUrlCollection = new JsonRpcUrlCollection(logManager, jsonRpcConfig, includeWebSockets);\n\nforeach (var url in jsonRpcUrlCollection.Urls)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(url);\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class?\n- The `JsonRpcUrlCollection` class is a dictionary that stores `JsonRpcUrl` objects and implements the `IJsonRpcUrlCollection` interface. It is used to build and store a collection of JSON-RPC URLs based on the configuration settings.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable?\n- The `NETHERMIND_URL` environment variable is used to override the default JSON-RPC URL specified in the configuration settings. If the environment variable is set to a valid URL, it will be used instead of the default URL.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BuildAdditionalUrls` method?\n- The `BuildAdditionalUrls` method is used to add additional JSON-RPC URLs to the collection based on the configuration settings. It parses each URL, checks if it is valid and not already in use, and adds it to the collection if it meets the criteria.",
