  "summary": "The `JsonRpcSocketsClient` class is a client implementation for the JSON-RPC protocol over WebSockets. It extends the `SocketClient` class and implements the `IJsonRpcDuplexClient` interface. The class is responsible for processing incoming JSON-RPC requests, invoking the appropriate methods on the server, and sending back the response to the client.\n\nThe class has a constructor that takes several parameters, including the client name, the socket handler, the JSON-RPC processor, the JSON-RPC service, the JSON-RPC local statistics, the JSON serializer, and the maximum batch response body size. The constructor initializes the class fields with the provided values and creates a new `JsonRpcContext` object.\n\nThe class overrides the `ProcessAsync` method to process incoming JSON-RPC requests. The method deserializes the incoming data, processes the JSON-RPC requests using the `_jsonRpcProcessor` field, and sends back the response to the client. The method also updates the local statistics for each JSON-RPC call.\n\nThe class has a `SendJsonRpcResult` method that sends the JSON-RPC response to the client. If the response is a collection, the method sends each response in the collection separately. The method also updates the local statistics for each JSON-RPC call.\n\nThe class has several private methods that are used internally to increment the bytes received and sent metrics, serialize the JSON-RPC response, and handle exceptions.\n\nOverall, the `JsonRpcSocketsClient` class is an important component of the Nethermind project that enables clients to communicate with the server using the JSON-RPC protocol over WebSockets.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a class called `JsonRpcSocketsClient` which is used to process JSON-RPC requests and responses over websockets.\n\n2. What other classes does this code depend on?\n   - This code depends on several other classes including `SocketClient`, `IJsonRpcDuplexClient`, `IJsonRpcProcessor`, `IJsonRpcService`, `IJsonRpcLocalStats`, `IJsonSerializer`, `JsonRpcUrl`, and `JsonRpcResult`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `maxBatchResponseBodySize` parameter?\n   - The `maxBatchResponseBodySize` parameter is used to limit the size of the response body for batched JSON-RPC requests. If the size of the response body exceeds this limit, the server will stop responding to further requests in the batch.",
