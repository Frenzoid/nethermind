  "summary": "The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to request transactions from the transaction pool. It implements the `IPooledTxsRequestor` interface and has two methods: `RequestTransactions` and `RequestTransactionsEth66`. \n\nThe `RequestTransactions` method takes a list of transaction hashes and a delegate function that sends a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` to the peer. It first checks if the transaction hashes are already known to the transaction pool or not. If any of the hashes are unknown, it adds them to a list of discovered transaction hashes and sends a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` to the peer. \n\nThe `RequestTransactionsEth66` method is similar to `RequestTransactions`, but it takes a delegate function that sends a `V66.Messages.GetPooledTransactionsMessage` to the peer. It first creates a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` object with the discovered transaction hashes and then creates a `V66.Messages.GetPooledTransactionsMessage` object with the `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` object as a property. \n\nThe `AddMarkUnknownHashes` method is a private helper method that takes a list of transaction hashes and a list of discovered transaction hashes. It iterates through the list of transaction hashes and checks if each hash is known to the transaction pool or not. If a hash is unknown, it adds it to the list of discovered transaction hashes and marks it as pending in a cache. \n\nOverall, the `PooledTxsRequestor` class is used to request transactions from the transaction pool and send them to peers. It ensures that only unknown transaction hashes are requested and avoids requesting the same transaction hash multiple times.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class?\n    \n    The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is used to request pooled transactions from the transaction pool.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `LruKeyCache` instance `_pendingHashes`?\n    \n    The `_pendingHashes` cache is used to keep track of transaction hashes that have already been requested, so that they are not requested again unnecessarily.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `RequestTransactions` and `RequestTransactionsEth66` methods?\n    \n    The `RequestTransactions` method is used to request pooled transactions using the Eth65 subprotocol, while the `RequestTransactionsEth66` method is used to request pooled transactions using the Eth66 subprotocol.",
