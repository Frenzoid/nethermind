  "summary": "This code defines an enum called `LesAnnounceType` within the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Les` namespace. The purpose of this enum is to provide a set of options for the type of announcement that can be made within the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) network.\n\nThe `LesAnnounceType` enum has three options: `None`, `Simple`, and `Signed`. `None` is assigned a value of `0x00`, indicating that no announcement is being made. `Simple` is assigned a value of `0x01`, indicating that a simple announcement is being made. `Signed` is assigned a value of `0x02`, indicating that a signed announcement is being made.\n\nThis enum is likely used within the larger nethermind project to facilitate communication within the LES network. For example, when a node wants to announce a new block or transaction to the network, it can use the `LesAnnounceType` enum to specify the type of announcement being made. Other nodes within the network can then interpret the announcement accordingly based on the specified type.\n\nHere is an example of how this enum might be used within the nethermind project:\n\n```\nusing Nethermind.Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Les;\n\npublic class Node\n{\n    public void AnnounceNewBlock(Block block)\n    {\n        // Send a simple announcement to the LES network\n        LesAnnounceType announceType = LesAnnounceType.Simple;\n        // Send the block to the network\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    public void AnnounceNewTransaction(Transaction tx)\n    {\n        // Send a signed announcement to the LES network\n        LesAnnounceType announceType = LesAnnounceType.Signed;\n        // Sign the transaction\n        // Send the signed transaction to the network\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```",
