  "summary": "The code above defines a static class called `WitMessageCode` that contains three integer constants and a static method. This class is part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Wit` namespace.\n\nThe three integer constants represent message codes for the Wit subprotocol. The first constant, `Status`, is not used and is reserved for future use. The second constant, `GetBlockWitnessHashes`, represents a message code that is used to request block witness hashes from a peer. The third constant, `BlockWitnessHashes`, represents a message code that is used to send block witness hashes to a peer.\n\nThe `GetDescription` method is a static method that takes an integer code as input and returns a string that describes the code. This method is used to provide a human-readable description of the message codes. If the input code matches one of the defined constants, the method returns the name of the constant. If the input code does not match any of the defined constants, the method returns a string that indicates that the code is unknown.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger `Nethermind` project to define and handle messages for the Wit subprotocol. Other parts of the project can use the message codes defined in this class to send and receive messages related to block witness hashes. The `GetDescription` method can be used to provide a human-readable description of the message codes for debugging and logging purposes.\n\nExample usage of this class could be as follows:\n\n```\nint messageCode = WitMessageCode.GetBlockWitnessHashes;\nstring messageDescription = WitMessageCode.GetDescription(messageCode);\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Message code {messageCode} is {messageDescription}\");\n// Output: Message code 1 is GetBlockWitnessHashes\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines a static class `WitMessageCode` that contains constants and a method for getting a description of a message code.\n\n2. What are the possible values for the `code` parameter in the `GetDescription` method?\n   - The possible values for the `code` parameter are `0x00`, `0x01`, and `0x02`, which correspond to the `Status`, `GetBlockWitnessHashes`, and `BlockWitnessHashes` constants respectively.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?\n   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.",
