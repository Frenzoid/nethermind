  "summary": "The `CodeDataAnalyzerHelperTests` file is a test file that tests the `CodeDataAnalyzerHelper` class in the `Nethermind.Evm.CodeAnalysis` namespace. The purpose of the `CodeDataAnalyzerHelper` class is to provide methods for analyzing EVM bytecode. The `CreateCodeBitmap` method takes a byte array of EVM bytecode and returns a bitmap that represents the code's structure. The bitmap is an array of integers where each integer represents 32 bytes of code. Each bit in the integer represents a byte of code, with a value of 1 indicating that the byte is part of an instruction and a value of 0 indicating that the byte is not part of an instruction.\n\nThe `CodeDataAnalyzerHelperTests` file contains two test methods that test the `CreateCodeBitmap` method with different EVM bytecode inputs. The first test method, `Validate_CodeBitmap_With_Push10`, tests the method with EVM bytecode that contains a `PUSH10` instruction followed by a `JUMPDEST` instruction. The test asserts that the first two integers in the bitmap are equal to 127 and 224, respectively. These values represent the binary values of the first 10 bytes of the EVM bytecode, with the first byte being the `PUSH10` instruction and the next 10 bytes being the data pushed onto the stack.\n\nThe second test method, `Validate_CodeBitmap_With_Push30`, tests the method with EVM bytecode that contains a `PUSH30` instruction followed by a `JUMPDEST` instruction. The test asserts that the first four integers in the bitmap are equal to 127, 255, 255, and 254, respectively. These values represent the binary values of the first 30 bytes of the EVM bytecode, with the first byte being the `PUSH30` instruction and the next 30 bytes being the data pushed onto the stack.\n\nOverall, the `CodeDataAnalyzerHelper` class and its `CreateCodeBitmap` method are useful for analyzing EVM bytecode and determining the structure of the code. The test methods in the `CodeDataAnalyzerHelperTests` file ensure that the `CreateCodeBitmap` method works as expected with different inputs.",
