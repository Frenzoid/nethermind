The `JsonRpcUrlTests` class is a unit test class that tests the `JsonRpcUrl` class. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is responsible for parsing and validating JSON-RPC URLs. JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON. It is a lightweight protocol that is used to call methods on a remote server. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used in the Nethermind project to parse and validate JSON-RPC URLs.

The `JsonRpcUrlTests` class contains two test methods: `Parse_success` and `Parse_fail`. The `Parse_success` method tests the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method by passing in a valid JSON-RPC URL and verifying that the parsed URL matches the expected values. The `Parse_fail` method tests the `JsonRpcUrl.Parse` method by passing in an invalid JSON-RPC URL and verifying that the method throws the expected exception.

The `JsonRpcUrl` class has the following properties:

- `Scheme`: The scheme of the URL (e.g., http, https, ws, wss).
- `Host`: The host of the URL (e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1).
- `Port`: The port of the URL (e.g., 80, 443, 8545).
- `RpcEndpoint`: The RPC endpoint of the URL (e.g., Http, Ws, Ipc).
- `EnabledModules`: The enabled modules of the URL (e.g., eth, web3, net).

The `JsonRpcUrl` class has a `Parse` method that takes a packed URL string and returns a `JsonRpcUrl` object. The packed URL string is a pipe-separated string that contains the scheme, host, port, RPC endpoint, and enabled modules. The `Parse` method parses the packed URL string and returns a `JsonRpcUrl` object that contains the parsed values.

Here is an example of how to use the `JsonRpcUrl` class:

```csharp
string packedUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8545|http|eth;web3;net";
JsonRpcUrl url = JsonRpcUrl.Parse(packedUrl);

Console.WriteLine($"Scheme: {url.Scheme}");
Console.WriteLine($"Host: {url.Host}");
Console.WriteLine($"Port: {url.Port}");
Console.WriteLine($"RPC Endpoint: {url.RpcEndpoint}");
Console.WriteLine($"Enabled Modules: {string.Join(",", url.EnabledModules)}");
```

Output:

```
Scheme: http
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8545
RPC Endpoint: Http
Enabled Modules: eth,web3,net
```

In summary, the `JsonRpcUrlTests` class is a unit test class that tests the `JsonRpcUrl` class. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is responsible for parsing and validating JSON-RPC URLs. The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used in the Nethermind project to parse and validate JSON-RPC URLs. The `JsonRpcUrl` class has a `Parse` method that takes a packed URL string and returns a `JsonRpcUrl` object. The `JsonRpcUrl` object contains the parsed values of the URL.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JsonRpcUrl` class and what does it do?
- The `JsonRpcUrl` class is used to parse and validate JSON-RPC URLs. The `Parse_success` method tests the successful parsing of a URL, while the `Parse_fail` method tests the expected exceptions when parsing invalid URLs.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `JsonRpcUrlTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `JsonRpcUrlTests` class can be run in parallel. The `ParallelScope.All` argument specifies that all tests can be run in parallel.

3. What is the purpose of the `RpcEndpoint` enum and how is it used in the `Parse_success` method?
- The `RpcEndpoint` enum is used to specify the endpoint type of a JSON-RPC URL, which can be either HTTP or WebSocket. In the `Parse_success` method, the `RpcEndpoint` enum is used to set the expected endpoint type of the parsed URL, which is then compared to the actual endpoint type of the `JsonRpcUrl` object.
