The code is a unit test for the EthStatsClient class in the Nethermind project. The EthStatsClient class is responsible for building a URL for the EthStats API based on the configuration URL provided. The BuildUrl method takes the configuration URL and appends the appropriate protocol (ws or wss) based on the scheme of the configuration URL. The method also appends the "/api" path to the URL.

The unit test contains two test cases. The first test case tests the BuildUrl method with valid configuration URLs and expected URLs. The test case creates an instance of the EthStatsClient class with the configuration URL and asserts that the BuildUrl method returns the expected URL.

The second test case tests the BuildUrl method with invalid configuration URLs. The test case creates an instance of the EthStatsClient class with the invalid configuration URL and asserts that the BuildUrl method throws an ArgumentException.

This unit test ensures that the BuildUrl method of the EthStatsClient class works as expected and handles invalid configuration URLs correctly. The EthStatsClient class is used in the larger Nethermind project to build the URL for the EthStats API, which is used to collect and display Ethereum network statistics.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EthStatsClientTests` class?
- The `EthStatsClientTests` class is a test class that contains two test methods for testing the `BuildUrl` method of the `EthStatsClient` class.

2. What is the significance of the `TestCase` attribute in the `Build_url_should_return_expected_results` method?
- The `TestCase` attribute is used to specify multiple test cases for the same test method. In this case, the `Build_url_should_return_expected_results` method is being tested with different input values for `configUrl` and `expectedUrl`.

3. What is the purpose of the `Incorrect_url_should_throw_exception` method?
- The `Incorrect_url_should_throw_exception` method is a test method that checks if an exception is thrown when an incorrect URL is passed to the `EthStatsClient` constructor.
