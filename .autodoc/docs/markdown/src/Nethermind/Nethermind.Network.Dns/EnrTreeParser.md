The `EnrTreeParser` class is responsible for parsing different types of nodes in an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Resource Record (RR) tree. ENS is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain that maps human-readable domain names to machine-readable identifiers, such as Ethereum addresses. The `EnrTreeParser` class is part of the `Nethermind` project, which is an Ethereum client implementation written in C#.

The `EnrTreeParser` class is a static class that contains several static methods for parsing different types of nodes in an ENS RR tree. The `ParseNode` method is the main entry point for parsing a node in the ENS RR tree. It takes a string representation of an ENS node and returns an `EnrTreeNode` object that represents the parsed node. The `ParseNode` method first checks the type of the node by looking at the prefix of the input string. If the prefix matches one of the supported node types, the corresponding parsing method is called. If the prefix does not match any of the supported node types, a `NotSupportedException` is thrown.

The `EnrTreeParser` class supports four types of nodes: `EnrLinkedTree`, `EnrLeaf`, `EnrTreeBranch`, and `EnrTreeRoot`. The `EnrLinkedTree` node represents a linked tree in the ENS RR tree. The `ParseEnrLinkedTree` method parses the input string and returns an `EnrLinkedTree` object that contains the link to the linked tree. The `EnrLeaf` node represents a leaf node in the ENS RR tree that contains an Ethereum Name Record (ENR). The `ParseEnrLeaf` method parses the input string and returns an `EnrLeaf` object that contains the ENR. The `EnrTreeBranch` node represents a branch node in the ENS RR tree that contains a list of hashes of child nodes. The `ParseBranch` method parses the input string and returns an `EnrTreeBranch` object that contains the list of hashes. The `EnrTreeRoot` node represents the root node in the ENS RR tree that contains the root hash, link hash, sequence number, and signature of the ENS RR tree. The `ParseEnrRoot` method parses the input string and returns an `EnrTreeRoot` object that contains the parsed fields.

Overall, the `EnrTreeParser` class is an important component of the `Nethermind` project that enables parsing of different types of nodes in the ENS RR tree. This functionality is essential for interacting with the ENS system and resolving human-readable domain names to Ethereum addresses. Below is an example of how to use the `EnrTreeParser` class to parse an ENS node:

```csharp
string enrNodeText = "enr:...";
EnrTreeNode enrNode = EnrTreeParser.ParseNode(enrNodeText);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a static class `EnrTreeParser` with methods for parsing different types of ENR tree nodes.

2. What is an ENR tree and what are its components?
- An ENR tree is a Merkle tree of Ethereum Node Records (ENRs). The components of an ENR tree include ENR leaves, ENR tree branches, and ENR tree roots.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by the `ParseNode` method and why?
- The `ParseNode` method can throw a `NotSupportedException` if the input `enrTreeNodeText` does not start with any of the supported prefixes (`enrtree-branch:`, `enrtree-root:`, `enr:`, or `enrtree://`). This is because the method only supports parsing these specific types of ENR tree nodes.
