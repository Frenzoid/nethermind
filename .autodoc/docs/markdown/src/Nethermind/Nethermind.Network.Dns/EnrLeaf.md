The `EnrLeaf` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Nethermind.Network.Dns` namespace. This class represents a leaf node in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Resource Record (RR) tree. The ENS is a decentralized domain name system that maps human-readable domain names to machine-readable identifiers, such as Ethereum addresses. The `EnrLeaf` class is used to store a node record in the ENS tree.

The `EnrLeaf` class inherits from the `EnrTreeNode` class, which is an abstract class that defines the basic structure of a node in the ENS tree. The `EnrLeaf` class overrides the `ToString()` method to return a string representation of the node record in the format `enr:{NodeRecord}`. The `NodeRecord` property is a string that stores the node record encoded as a URL-safe base64 string.

The `Links`, `Refs`, and `Records` properties are overridden to return empty arrays or an array containing the `NodeRecord` property, depending on the property type. These properties are used to retrieve the links, references, and records associated with a node in the ENS tree.

An example usage of the `EnrLeaf` class would be to create a new instance of the class and set the `NodeRecord` property to the encoded node record. This instance can then be added to the ENS tree as a leaf node using the appropriate methods provided by the `Nethermind` project.

Overall, the `EnrLeaf` class provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve node records in the ENS tree, which is an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EnrLeaf` class?
   - The `EnrLeaf` class is a subclass of `EnrTreeNode` and represents a leaf node in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Resource Record (RR) tree. It contains a node record encoded as a URL-safe base64 string.

2. What is the significance of the `enr:` prefix in the `ToString()` method?
   - The `enr:` prefix is used to indicate that the string representation of an `EnrLeaf` object is an Ethereum Name Service Record (ENR). This is a standard format for encoding metadata about Ethereum nodes.

3. What are the `Links`, `Refs`, and `Records` properties used for?
   - The `Links`, `Refs`, and `Records` properties are all arrays of strings that represent different types of data associated with an `EnrLeaf` object. `Links` and `Refs` are empty arrays, while `Records` contains a single element that is the `NodeRecord` property of the object.
