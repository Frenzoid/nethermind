The code provided is a C# class called `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` that is a part of the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to compare transactions based on their priority on a specified block. 

The class inherits from another class called `CompareTxByPriorityBase` and overrides a property called `BlockHeader`. The constructor of this class takes in three parameters: an instance of `IContractDataStore<Address>` called `sendersWhitelist`, an instance of `IDictionaryContractDataStore<TxPriorityContract.Destination>` called `priorities`, and an instance of `BlockHeader` called `blockHeader`. 

The `sendersWhitelist` parameter is used to whitelist specific addresses that are allowed to send transactions. The `priorities` parameter is used to store the priority of each transaction based on its destination. The `blockHeader` parameter is used to specify the block on which the transactions will be compared. 

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to prioritize transactions based on their destination and the block on which they are being processed. This can be useful in a consensus algorithm like AuRa, where transactions need to be processed in a specific order to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
var sendersWhitelist = new ContractDataStore<Address>();
var priorities = new DictionaryContractDataStore<TxPriorityContract.Destination>();
var blockHeader = new BlockHeader();

var compareTxByPriority = new CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock(sendersWhitelist, priorities, blockHeader);

// Add transactions to the priority dictionary
priorities.Add(new TxPriorityContract.Destination(), new Int256(1));

// Compare transactions based on priority on the specified block
var result = compareTxByPriority.Compare(new Transaction(), new Transaction());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` that extends another class called `CompareTxByPriorityBase`. It takes in a whitelist of senders, a dictionary of transaction priorities, and a block header as parameters.

2. What is the `CompareTxByPriorityBase` class that this code is extending?
   - The `CompareTxByPriorityBase` class is not shown in this code snippet, but it is being extended by the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class. It is likely that the `CompareTxByPriorityBase` class contains some common functionality that is being reused by this class.

3. What is the purpose of the `BlockHeader` property in this class?
   - The `BlockHeader` property is being set in the constructor of the `CompareTxByPriorityOnSpecifiedBlock` class and is used in the implementation of the `Compare` method in the `CompareTxByPriorityBase` class. It is likely that the `BlockHeader` is being used to filter transactions based on some criteria related to the block header.
