The `TxGasPriceSender` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for nonposdao AuRa chains. It is responsible for sending transactions and setting the gas price for those transactions. The gas price is estimated using an `IGasPriceOracle` instance, and then multiplied by a percentage delta value. The resulting gas price is then set as the `DecodedMaxFeePerGas` and `GasPrice` properties of the transaction object. Finally, the transaction is sent using the `_txSender` instance.

This class is useful for setting the gas price for transactions on nonposdao AuRa chains, where the validator pays for the transaction. By using an `IGasPriceOracle` instance to estimate the gas price, the gas price can be set dynamically based on the current network conditions. The percentage delta value allows for some flexibility in adjusting the gas price estimate.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
// create an instance of the TxGasPriceSender class
var txGasPriceSender = new TxGasPriceSender(
    txSender: myTxSenderInstance,
    gasPriceOracle: myGasPriceOracleInstance,
    percentDelta: 110 // set the percentage delta to 110%
);

// create a new transaction object
var tx = new Transaction
{
    // set the transaction properties
};

// send the transaction using the TxGasPriceSender instance
var result = await txGasPriceSender.SendTransaction(tx, myTxHandlingOptions);
```

In this example, a new instance of the `TxGasPriceSender` class is created with a `txSender` instance and a `gasPriceOracle` instance. The percentage delta is set to 110%, which means that the estimated gas price will be increased by 10%. A new transaction object is created, and then the `SendTransaction` method is called on the `txGasPriceSender` instance to send the transaction. The `myTxHandlingOptions` parameter is used to specify any additional handling options for the transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `TxGasPriceSender` that implements the `ITxSender` interface and is used for nonposdao AuRa chains to pay for transactions using the validator's funds. It solves the problem of how to pay for transactions on these chains.

2. What are the parameters of the `TxGasPriceSender` constructor and what do they do?
- The `TxGasPriceSender` constructor takes in an `ITxSender` object, an `IGasPriceOracle` object, and an optional `uint` value called `percentDelta`. The `ITxSender` object is used to send transactions, the `IGasPriceOracle` object is used to estimate the gas price, and the `percentDelta` value is used to adjust the estimated gas price.

3. What does the `SendTransaction` method do and how does it use the `gasPriceEstimated` value?
- The `SendTransaction` method takes in a `Transaction` object and a `TxHandlingOptions` object and returns a tuple containing a `Keccak` object and an `AcceptTxResult` object. It first calculates an estimated gas price using the `IGasPriceOracle` object and the `percentDelta` value, and then sets the `DecodedMaxFeePerGas` and `GasPrice` properties of the `Transaction` object to this estimated gas price. Finally, it calls the `_txSender.SendTransaction` method with the modified `Transaction` object and the `TxHandlingOptions` object.
