The code above defines a static class called `TxGasPriceSenderConstants` that contains two constants related to gas prices for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `UInt256` type is imported from the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace.

The first constant, `DefaultGasPrice`, is a `UInt256` value set to 20,000,000. This value represents the default gas price that will be used for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm if no other gas price is specified. Gas price is the amount of ether that a user is willing to pay per unit of gas to execute a transaction on the Ethereum network. The higher the gas price, the faster the transaction will be processed by the network.

The second constant, `DefaultPercentMultiplier`, is an unsigned integer set to 110. This value represents the default percentage multiplier that will be used to calculate the maximum gas price for a transaction in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The maximum gas price is calculated by multiplying the `DefaultGasPrice` by the `DefaultPercentMultiplier` and dividing the result by 100. For example, if `DefaultGasPrice` is 20,000,000 and `DefaultPercentMultiplier` is 110, then the maximum gas price for a transaction would be 22,000,000 (20,000,000 * 110 / 100).

This class is likely used throughout the larger project to provide default values for gas prices and to calculate maximum gas prices for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm. Other parts of the project can import this class and use its constants to set gas prices for transactions or to calculate maximum gas prices based on the default values. For example, a smart contract that is part of the AuRa consensus algorithm could use the `DefaultGasPrice` constant to set a default gas price for its transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a static class called `TxGasPriceSenderConstants` that contains two constants related to gas prices in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the data type of the `DefaultGasPrice` constant?
- The `DefaultGasPrice` constant is of type `UInt256`, which is a custom data type defined in the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace.

3. What is the significance of the `DefaultPercentMultiplier` constant?
- The `DefaultPercentMultiplier` constant is a percentage multiplier used in calculating the maximum gas price for transactions in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is set to 110, which means the maximum gas price is 10% higher than the default gas price.
