The code defines an interface called `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` which extends another interface called `IBlockFinalizationManager`. This interface is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `nethermind.Consensus.AuRa` namespace. 

The purpose of this interface is to provide methods for getting information about the finalization of blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The AuRa consensus algorithm is a consensus algorithm used in the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to determine which blocks are added to the blockchain and which are not. 

The first method defined in the interface is `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy`. This method takes a block hash as input and returns the last level that was finalized by that block hash. This method is used when there is nonconsecutive block processing, such as switching from Fast to Full sync or when producing blocks. It is used when trying to find a non-finalized InitChange event. 

The second method defined in the interface is `GetFinalizationLevel`. This method takes a level as input and returns the level at which finalization happened. If the checked level is not yet finalized, the method returns null. This method is used to get information about the finalization of blocks at a certain level. 

Overall, this interface provides methods for getting information about the finalization of blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is used in the larger `Nethermind` project to implement the AuRa consensus algorithm in the Ethereum blockchain. 

Example usage:

```
IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager blockFinalizationManager = new AuRaBlockFinalizationManager();
Keccak blockHash = new Keccak("block hash");
long lastLevelFinalized = blockFinalizationManager.GetLastLevelFinalizedBy(blockHash);
long? finalizationLevel = blockFinalizationManager.GetFinalizationLevel(lastLevelFinalized);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines an interface called `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` which extends `IBlockFinalizationManager` and provides two methods for getting information about block finalization in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the difference between `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` and `GetFinalizationLevel` methods?
   - `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` method takes a block hash as input and returns the last level that was finalized by that block hash. It is used when trying to find a non-finalized InitChange event. On the other hand, `GetFinalizationLevel` method takes a level as input and returns the level at which finalization happened. It returns null if the checked level is not yet finalized.

3. What is the relationship between this code file and the rest of the `nethermind` project?
   - This code file is part of the `nethermind` project and specifically relates to the implementation of the AuRa consensus algorithm. It defines an interface that other parts of the project can use to get information about block finalization in the AuRa consensus algorithm.
