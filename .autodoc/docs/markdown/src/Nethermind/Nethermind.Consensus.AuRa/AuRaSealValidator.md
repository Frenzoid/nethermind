The `AuRaSealValidator` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for validating the block headers of the AuRa consensus algorithm. The class implements the `ISealValidator` interface and provides two methods: `ValidateParams` and `ValidateSeal`. 

The `ValidateParams` method is used to validate the parameters of the block header. It takes two block headers as input: the parent block header and the current block header. The method checks if the current block header has a valid signature, a valid step value, and a valid proposer. It also checks if the step value of the current block header is greater than or equal to the step value of the parent block header. If the validation fails, the method returns false. 

The `ValidateSeal` method is used to validate the seal of the block header. It takes a block header as input and checks if the author of the block header matches the beneficiary of the block header. If the validation fails, the method returns false. 

The `AuRaSealValidator` class uses several other classes and interfaces from the Nethermind project, such as `AuRaParameters`, `IAuRaStepCalculator`, `IBlockTree`, `IValidatorStore`, `IValidSealerStrategy`, `IEthereumEcdsa`, `ILogger`, `IReportingValidator`, `NullReportingValidator`, `Keccak`, and `Signature`. 

Overall, the `AuRaSealValidator` class plays a crucial role in the AuRa consensus algorithm of the Nethermind project by ensuring that the block headers are valid and secure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuRaSealValidator` class?
- The `AuRaSealValidator` class is a seal validator for the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind blockchain project.

2. What are the dependencies of the `AuRaSealValidator` class?
- The `AuRaSealValidator` class depends on `AuRaParameters`, `IAuRaStepCalculator`, `IBlockTree`, `IValidatorStore`, `IValidSealerStrategy`, `IEthereumEcdsa`, and `ILogManager`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReceivedSteps` class?
- The `ReceivedSteps` class is used to keep track of blocks received by the `AuRaSealValidator` class and detect malicious behavior such as producing sibling blocks in the same step.
