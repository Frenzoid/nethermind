This file contains code for the CertifierContract class and the ICertifierContract interface. The CertifierContract class is a contract that implements the ICertifierContract interface. The purpose of this contract is to provide a way to certify blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

The ICertifierContract interface defines a single method, Certified, which takes a BlockHeader object and an Address object as parameters and returns a boolean value. This method is used to certify a block by checking if the given parentHeader and sender are valid.

The CertifierContract class extends the RegisterBasedContract class and implements the ICertifierContract interface. It has a private field named Constant of type IConstantContract. The constructor of the CertifierContract class takes three parameters: an IAbiEncoder object, an IRegisterContract object, and an IReadOnlyTxProcessorSource object. The constructor calls the base constructor of the RegisterBasedContract class and initializes the Constant field by calling the GetConstant method with the readOnlyTransactionProcessorSource parameter.

The Certified method of the CertifierContract class calls the Call method of the Constant field with a CallInfo object as a parameter. The CallInfo object contains the parentHeader, sender, and the name of the Certified method. If the call to the Constant field fails, the MissingCertifiedResult object is returned.

Overall, this code provides a way to certify blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm by implementing the ICertifierContract interface and using the CertifierContract class. The CertifierContract class uses the RegisterBasedContract class to register the contract and the IConstantContract interface to call the Certified method. This code is an important part of the nethermind project as it provides a way to certify blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ICertifierContract` interface?
   - The `ICertifierContract` interface defines a method `Certified` that takes a `BlockHeader` and an `Address` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the block header has been certified by the sender.

2. What is the `CertifierContract` class and how does it relate to the `ICertifierContract` interface?
   - The `CertifierContract` class implements the `ICertifierContract` interface and provides an implementation for the `Certified` method. It inherits from `RegisterBasedContract` and uses the `Constant` property to call the `Certified` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `ServiceTransactionContractRegistryName` constant?
   - The `ServiceTransactionContractRegistryName` constant is used as the name of the registry where the `CertifierContract` is registered as a service transaction contract.
