The `VersionedContract` class is a generic abstract class that provides a way to manage different versions of a contract. It implements the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Activation` property. The class takes a generic type parameter `T`, which must implement the `IVersionedContract` interface. The `IVersionedContract` interface defines a single method `ContractVersion`, which takes a `BlockHeader` object and returns a `UInt256` value representing the version of the contract.

The `VersionedContract` class has a constructor that takes an `IDictionary<UInt256, T>` object, which maps version numbers to contract instances, a `LruCache<KeccakKey, UInt256>` object, which caches the version number for a given block hash, a `long` value representing the activation block number, and an `ILogManager` object for logging. The constructor initializes the private fields and throws an exception if any of the arguments are null.

The `ResolveVersion` method takes a `BlockHeader` object and returns the contract instance corresponding to the version number of the contract specified in the `BlockHeader`. The method first checks if the block is activated by calling the `BlockActivationCheck` extension method. If the version number is not found in the cache, it calls the `ContractVersion` method of the `_versionSelectorContract` object to get the version number and caches it. If the `ContractVersion` method throws an `AbiException`, it logs the exception and sets the version number to `UInt256.One`. Finally, it calls the `ResolveVersion` method with the version number to get the corresponding contract instance.

The `ResolveVersion` method calls the private `ResolveVersion` method, which takes a `UInt256` object representing the version number and returns the corresponding contract instance from the `_versions` dictionary. If the version number is not found in the dictionary, it returns the default value of the generic type parameter `T`.

Overall, the `VersionedContract` class provides a way to manage different versions of a contract and resolve the correct version based on the version number specified in the `BlockHeader`. This class can be used in the larger project to manage different versions of contracts in the AuRa consensus algorithm. For example, it can be used to manage different versions of the `StakingAuRa` contract, which is used to stake tokens and participate in block validation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VersionedContract` class?
    
    The `VersionedContract` class is an abstract class that implements the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface and provides functionality for resolving the version of a contract based on the block header.

2. What is the significance of the `IVersionedContract` interface constraint on the generic type parameter `T`?
    
    The `IVersionedContract` interface constraint on the generic type parameter `T` ensures that only types that implement the `IVersionedContract` interface can be used as the type argument for `T`.

3. What is the purpose of the `LruCache` field `_versionsCache`?
    
    The `LruCache` field `_versionsCache` is used to cache the version number of a contract for a given block header hash, in order to avoid recomputing the version number for the same block header multiple times.
