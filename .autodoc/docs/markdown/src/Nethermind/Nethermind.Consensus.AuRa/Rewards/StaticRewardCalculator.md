The `StaticRewardCalculator` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for calculating rewards for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The class implements the `IRewardCalculator` interface and provides a method to calculate rewards for a given block. 

The constructor of the `StaticRewardCalculator` class takes an optional dictionary of block rewards as input. This dictionary contains the block number as the key and the reward amount as the value. If the dictionary is not provided or is empty, the default reward is set to 0 for all blocks. 

The `CalculateRewards` method takes a `Block` object as input and returns an array of `BlockReward` objects. The `BlockReward` object contains the beneficiary address and the reward amount. The method first retrieves the reward amount for the given block number from the `_blockRewards` list using the `TryGetForActivation` method. If the reward amount is not found, the default reward of 0 is used. The method then creates a new `BlockReward` object with the beneficiary address of the input block and the retrieved reward amount. Finally, the method returns an array of `BlockReward` objects containing the newly created `BlockReward` object.

The `CreateBlockRewards` method is a private helper method that creates a list of `BlockRewardInfo` objects from the input dictionary of block rewards. If the input dictionary is not provided or is empty, a default `BlockRewardInfo` object with a block number of 0 and a reward of 0 is added to the list. If the input dictionary is provided, the method iterates over the dictionary and creates a new `BlockRewardInfo` object for each key-value pair. The list of `BlockRewardInfo` objects is then returned.

Overall, the `StaticRewardCalculator` class provides a simple way to calculate rewards for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It allows for customization of rewards for specific blocks by providing a dictionary of block rewards as input. The class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to calculate rewards for blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

Example usage:

```
// create a dictionary of block rewards
var blockRewards = new Dictionary<long, UInt256>
{
    { 0, 1000 },
    { 100, 2000 },
    { 200, 3000 }
};

// create a new StaticRewardCalculator object with the block rewards dictionary
var rewardCalculator = new StaticRewardCalculator(blockRewards);

// create a new block object
var block = new Block
{
    Number = 100,
    Beneficiary = "0x1234567890abcdef"
};

// calculate rewards for the block using the reward calculator
var rewards = rewardCalculator.CalculateRewards(block);

// print the rewards
foreach (var reward in rewards)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Beneficiary: {reward.Beneficiary}, Reward: {reward.Amount}");
}
// Output: Beneficiary: 0x1234567890abcdef, Reward: 2000
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `StaticRewardCalculator` that implements the `IRewardCalculator` interface and calculates rewards for a given block based on a set of block rewards.

2. What is the significance of the `CreateBlockRewards` method?
   - The `CreateBlockRewards` method creates a list of `BlockRewardInfo` objects based on a dictionary of block rewards. If the dictionary is empty, it creates a single `BlockRewardInfo` object with a block number of 0 and a reward of 0.

3. What is the purpose of the `BlockRewardInfo` class?
   - The `BlockRewardInfo` class is a private nested class that implements the `IActivatedAt` interface and represents a block reward threshold. It has a block number and a reward amount, and is used to create a list of block rewards in the `CreateBlockRewards` method.
