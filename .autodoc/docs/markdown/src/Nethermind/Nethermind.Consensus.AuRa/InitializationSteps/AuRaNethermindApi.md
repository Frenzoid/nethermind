[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa/InitializationSteps/AuRaNethermindApi.cs)

The code defines a class called `AuRaNethermindApi` that extends the `NethermindApi` class. This class is used in the larger project to initialize and configure various components related to the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

The `AuRaNethermindApi` class has several properties that can be used to set or get different components of the consensus algorithm. For example, the `FinalizationManager` property is used to get or set the block finalization manager, which is responsible for finalizing blocks in the chain. The `TxFilterCache` property is used to get or set the cache for transaction filters, which are used to filter out invalid transactions. The `ValidatorStore` property is used to get or set the validator store, which is responsible for storing and managing validators in the consensus algorithm.

The class also has several cache properties, such as `TransactionPermissionContractVersions` and `GasLimitCalculatorCache`, which are used to cache certain data related to the consensus algorithm. These caches are implemented using the `LruCache` class, which is a cache that uses a least-recently-used eviction policy.

Finally, the class has a property called `ReportingValidator`, which is used to get or set the reporting validator, which is responsible for validating reports submitted by validators in the consensus algorithm. The `ReportingContractValidatorCache` property is used to cache certain data related to the reporting validator.

Overall, the `AuRaNethermindApi` class is an important component of the AuRa consensus algorithm in the larger Nethermind project. It provides a way to configure and manage various components of the consensus algorithm, as well as cache certain data to improve performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file defines a class called `AuRaNethermindApi` which extends `NethermindApi` and adds several properties related to the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the significance of the `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface and how is it used in this code?
    
    The `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface is used to manage the finalization of blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm. In this code, the `FinalizationManager` property is overridden to ensure that it is of type `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReportingContractBasedValidator.Cache` property and how is it used?
    
    The `ReportingContractBasedValidator.Cache` property is used to cache the results of validating blocks using the reporting contract-based validator in the AuRa consensus algorithm. It is initialized when an instance of `AuRaNethermindApi` is created and can be accessed using the `ReportingContractValidatorCache` property.
