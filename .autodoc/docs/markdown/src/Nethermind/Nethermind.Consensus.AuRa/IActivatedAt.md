This code defines a set of interfaces and an extension method related to the concept of activation in the context of the AuRa consensus algorithm used in the Nethermind project. 

The `IActivatedAt` interface defines a property `Activation` of type `long` that represents the block number at which a certain feature or behavior is activated. This interface is then extended by the `IActivatedAtBlock` interface, which adds a default implementation of `ActivationBlock` that returns the value of `Activation`. 

The `IActivatedAt<T>` interface is a generic version of `IActivatedAt` that allows the type of `Activation` to be specified as a type parameter. This interface is not used directly in this file, but it may be used elsewhere in the project.

Finally, the `ActivatedAtBlockExtensions` class defines an extension method `BlockActivationCheck` that checks whether a given `IActivatedAtBlock` instance is active for a given block, based on the block's parent header. If the block number of the parent header plus one is less than the activation block of the `IActivatedAtBlock` instance, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown with a message indicating that the feature is not yet active. 

This code is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project that implement the AuRa consensus algorithm, to check whether certain features or behaviors are active for a given block. For example, a validator node may use this code to check whether a certain validator is eligible to propose a block at a given height, based on the activation block of the validator's key. 

Example usage:

```
using Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa;

// create an instance of IActivatedAtBlock
var myFeature = new MyFeature { Activation = 100 };

// check if myFeature is active for block 101
myFeature.BlockActivationCheck(parentHeader);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IActivatedAt` interface and its derived interfaces?
- The `IActivatedAt` interface and its derived interfaces are used to define objects that have an activation point, with `IActivatedAtBlock` specifically defining an activation block.

2. What is the purpose of the `BlockActivationCheck` method in the `ActivatedAtBlockExtensions` class?
- The `BlockActivationCheck` method is used to check if an `IActivatedAtBlock` object is active for a given block, based on its activation block and the parent block header.

3. What is the significance of the `LGPL-3.0-only` license in the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
- The `LGPL-3.0-only` license indicates that the code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0 only, and not under any later version of the license.
