The `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class is a validator implementation for the AuRa consensus algorithm in the Nethermind project. It implements the `ITxSource` interface, which defines a method for getting transactions to include in a new block. 

The `GetTransactions` method first calls the `GetTransactions` method of a `_contractValidator` instance to get transactions from the validator contract. Then, if the current block number is greater than the parent block number and the `_contractValidator` instance is for sealing and the consensus algorithm is Posdao, it filters and returns up to `MaxReportsPerBlock` transactions created from persistent reports. 

The `GetPersistentReportsTransactions` method returns transactions created from persistent reports that are older than `ReportsSkipBlocks` blocks. The `ResendPersistedReports` method resends persistent reports that are not older than `ReportsSkipBlocks` blocks and removes reports that are no longer valid. The `FilterReports` method removes reports that are no longer valid by checking if the validator contract should report the malicious behavior of the validator. The `TruncateReports` method removes reports that exceed `MaxQueuedReports`.

The `PersistentReport` class is a simple data class that holds information about a persistent report, including the malicious validator's address, the block number, and the proof. 

Overall, this code provides a way to include transactions created from persistent reports in new blocks and ensures that only valid reports are included. It is an important part of the AuRa consensus algorithm in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class?
- The `ReportingContractBasedValidator` class is a partial class that implements the `ITxSource` interface and is used to get transactions for a block.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxQueuedReports` and `MaxReportsPerBlock` constants?
- `MaxQueuedReports` is the maximum number of reports to keep queued, while `MaxReportsPerBlock` is the maximum number of malice reports to include when creating a new block.

3. What is the purpose of the `ResendPersistedReports` method?
- The `ResendPersistedReports` method is used to resend queued malicious behavior reports for the current block if the block number is greater than `_sentReportsInBlock + ReportsSkipBlocks`.
