The `ValidatorInfo` class is a part of the `nethermind` project and is located in the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Validators` namespace. This class is responsible for storing information about validators in the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

The `ValidatorInfo` class has three properties: `FinalizingBlockNumber`, `PreviousFinalizingBlockNumber`, and `Validators`. The `FinalizingBlockNumber` property stores the block number that the validators have agreed upon as the final block. The `PreviousFinalizingBlockNumber` property stores the block number of the previous final block. The `Validators` property is an array of `Address` objects that represent the validators in the network.

The `ValidatorInfo` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `finalizingBlockNumber`, `previousFinalizingBlockNumber`, and `validators`. These parameters are used to initialize the corresponding properties of the `ValidatorInfo` object.

The `ValidatorInfo` class also has a static constructor that initializes the `Rlp.Decoders` dictionary with a `ValidatorInfoDecoder` object. This is used to deserialize `ValidatorInfo` objects from RLP-encoded data.

Overall, the `ValidatorInfo` class is an important part of the AuRa consensus algorithm in the `nethermind` project. It stores information about the validators in the network and can be used to deserialize RLP-encoded data. Here is an example of how to create a `ValidatorInfo` object:

```
Address[] validators = new Address[] { new Address("0x123"), new Address("0x456") };
ValidatorInfo info = new ValidatorInfo(1000, 900, validators);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `ValidatorInfo` in the `Nethermind.Consensus.AuRa.Validators` namespace, which contains information about validators in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the significance of the `Rlp.Decoders` line in the static constructor?
- This line sets the RLP decoder for the `ValidatorInfo` class to be an instance of the `ValidatorInfoDecoder` class, which is responsible for decoding RLP-encoded `ValidatorInfo` objects.

3. What information does the `ValidatorInfo` class store?
- The `ValidatorInfo` class stores information about validators in the AuRa consensus algorithm, including the finalizing block number, previous finalizing block number, and an array of validator addresses.
