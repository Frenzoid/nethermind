The `InvalidBlockInterceptorTest` class is a unit test for the `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class. The `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class is responsible for intercepting invalid blocks and reporting them to the `IInvalidChainTracker`. The `IInvalidChainTracker` is an interface that defines methods for tracking invalid blocks in the chain.

The `InvalidBlockInterceptorTest` class tests the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` and `ValidateProcessedBlock` methods of the `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class. These methods are responsible for validating suggested and processed blocks respectively. The tests use the `NSubstitute` library to create a mock `IBlockValidator` and `IInvalidChainTracker` objects.

The `TestValidateSuggestedBlock` and `TestValidateProcessedBlock` methods test the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` and `ValidateProcessedBlock` methods respectively. They create a block object using the `Build.A.Block.TestObject` method from the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace. They then set up the mock `IBlockValidator` object to return a boolean value indicating whether the block is valid or not. The `InvalidBlockInterceptor` object is then used to validate the block. Finally, the tests check whether the `SetChildParent` and `OnInvalidBlock` methods of the `IInvalidChainTracker` object were called with the correct parameters.

The `TestInvalidBlockhashShouldNotGetTracked`, `TestBlockWithNotMatchingTxShouldNotGetTracked`, and `TestBlockWithIncorrectWithdrawalsShouldNotGetTracked` methods test the `ValidateSuggestedBlock` method of the `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class. They create a block object using the `Build.A.Block.TestObject` method from the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace. They then modify the block object to make it invalid. Finally, the tests check whether the `SetChildParent` and `OnInvalidBlock` methods of the `IInvalidChainTracker` object were not called.

Overall, the `InvalidBlockInterceptorTest` class tests the functionality of the `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class and ensures that it correctly reports invalid blocks to the `IInvalidChainTracker`. This is an important part of the larger project as it helps to maintain the integrity of the blockchain by identifying and tracking invalid blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class?
- The `InvalidBlockInterceptor` class intercepts block validation calls and tracks invalid blocks using an `IInvalidChainTracker` instance.

2. What is the role of the `IBlockValidator` and `IInvalidChainTracker` interfaces?
- The `IBlockValidator` interface is used to validate blocks, while the `IInvalidChainTracker` interface is used to track invalid blocks.

3. What is the purpose of the `TestBlockWithIncorrectWithdrawalsShouldNotGetTracked` test method?
- The `TestBlockWithIncorrectWithdrawalsShouldNotGetTracked` test method tests that a block with incorrect withdrawals should not be tracked as an invalid block.
