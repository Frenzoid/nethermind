The `EngineModuleTests` class contains tests for the `PayloadPreparationService` class of the Nethermind project. The `PayloadPreparationService` class is responsible for preparing payloads for block production. The tests in this class focus on testing the communication between the `PayloadPreparationService` and the `BoostRelay` class.

The first test, `forkchoiceUpdatedV1_should_communicate_with_boost_relay`, tests the communication between the `PayloadPreparationService` and the `BoostRelay` class. The test creates a `MergeTestBlockchain` instance and sets up a `BoostRelay` instance using the `Substitute` class. The `GetPayloadAttributes` method of the `BoostRelay` instance is set up to return a `PayloadAttributes` object with some modified properties. The `PayloadPreparationService` instance is then created with the `BoostBlockImprovementContextFactory` instance, which is created using the `BoostRelay` instance. The `CreateEngineModule` method is then called to create an instance of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface. The `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` method of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface is called with a `ForkchoiceStateV1` object and a `PayloadAttributes` object. The `PayloadPreparationService` instance then prepares a payload and sends it to the `BoostRelay` instance. The test then waits for the `BlockImproved` event to be raised by the `PayloadPreparationService` instance. Finally, the `engine_getPayloadV1` method of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface is called to retrieve the payload that was sent to the `BoostRelay` instance. The test asserts that the payload returned by the `engine_getPayloadV1` method is equivalent to the payload that was sent to the `BoostRelay` instance.

The second test, `forkchoiceUpdatedV1_should_communicate_with_boost_relay_through_http`, tests the communication between the `PayloadPreparationService` and the `BoostRelay` class over HTTP. The test creates a `MergeTestBlockchain` instance and sets up a `MockHttpMessageHandler` instance to mock the HTTP requests. The `BoostRelay` instance is then created with the `DefaultHttpClient` instance, which is created using the `MockHttpMessageHandler` instance. The `PayloadPreparationService` instance is then created with the `BoostBlockImprovementContextFactory` instance, which is created using the `BoostRelay` instance. The `CreateEngineModule` method is then called to create an instance of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface. The `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` method of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface is called with a `ForkchoiceStateV1` object and a `PayloadAttributes` object. The `PayloadPreparationService` instance then prepares a payload and sends it to the `BoostRelay` instance over HTTP. The test then waits for the `BlockImproved` event to be raised by the `PayloadPreparationService` instance. Finally, the `engine_getPayloadV1` method of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface is called to retrieve the payload that was sent to the `BoostRelay` instance. The test asserts that the payload returned by the `engine_getPayloadV1` method is equivalent to the payload that was sent to the `BoostRelay` instance.

The third test, `forkchoiceUpdatedV1_should_ignore_gas_limit`, tests that the `PayloadPreparationService` class ignores the `GasLimit` property of the `PayloadAttributes` object when the `BoostRelay` class is not used. The test creates a `MergeTestBlockchain` instance and sets up a `BlockImprovementContextFactory` instance. The `PayloadPreparationService` instance is then created with the `BlockImprovementContextFactory` instance. The `CreateEngineModule` method is then called to create an instance of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface. The `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` method of the `IEngineRpcModule` interface is called with a `ForkchoiceStateV1` object and a `PayloadAttributes` object with a `GasLimit` property. The test then retrieves the payload that was prepared by the `PayloadPreparationService` instance and asserts that the `GasLimit` property of the payload is equal to a default value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `forkchoiceUpdatedV1` method and how is it used in this code?
- The `forkchoiceUpdatedV1` method is used to update the fork choice of the blockchain with a new payload. In this code, it is called with a `ForkchoiceStateV1` object and a `PayloadAttributes` object to generate a new payload for the blockchain.

2. What is the role of the `BoostRelay` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `BoostRelay` class is used to communicate with a Boost node to obtain payload attributes and send execution payloads. In this code, it is used to obtain payload attributes in the `forkchoiceUpdatedV1_should_communicate_with_boost_relay` method and to send execution payloads in the `forkchoiceUpdatedV1_should_communicate_with_boost_relay_through_http` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `PayloadPreparationService` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `PayloadPreparationService` class is used to prepare payloads for the blockchain. In this code, it is used to prepare payloads for the merge block producer, using a `BlockImprovementContextFactory` or a `BoostBlockImprovementContextFactory` depending on whether a Boost relay is used or not.
