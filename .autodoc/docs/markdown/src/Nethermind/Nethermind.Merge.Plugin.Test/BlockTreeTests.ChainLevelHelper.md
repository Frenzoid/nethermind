This code contains a series of tests for the BlockTree class in the Nethermind Merge Plugin. The BlockTree class is responsible for managing the block tree data structure used in the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain. The tests are designed to ensure that the BlockTree class is functioning correctly and can sync blocks using chain levels.

The tests use the BlockTreeTestScenario class to set up a test scenario with a specific block tree configuration. The scenario is then used to test the BlockTree class by inserting beacon headers and blocks, suggesting blocks using chain levels, and asserting the expected results.

For example, the first test "Can_sync_using_chain_levels" sets up a scenario with 4 and 10 block trees, inserts a beacon pivot at block 7, inserts beacon headers at blocks 4 and 6, and inserts beacon blocks at blocks 8 and 9. It then suggests blocks using chain levels and asserts that the best known number is 9, the best suggested header is 9, and the best suggested body is 9.

The other tests follow a similar pattern, but with different scenarios and assertions. Some tests also include additional features, such as restarting the sync process or inserting a chain fork.

Overall, these tests ensure that the BlockTree class is functioning correctly and can handle various scenarios related to syncing blocks using chain levels. They are an important part of the Nethermind Merge Plugin project's testing suite and help ensure the reliability and stability of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockTreeTests` class?
- The `BlockTreeTests` class contains several test methods for syncing blocks using chain levels and checking correct levels after syncing.

2. What is the `BlockTreeTestScenario` class and where is it defined?
- The `BlockTreeTestScenario` class is used to set up test scenarios for syncing blocks and is defined elsewhere in the `nethermind` project.

3. What is the significance of the `TotalDifficultyMode` enum used in some of the test methods?
- The `TotalDifficultyMode` enum is used to specify the total difficulty of certain blocks in the test scenarios, with options for null, zero, or a specific value.
