The `ExternalRpcIntegrationTests` class contains two test methods that test the consistency of the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the blockchain is functioning correctly and that the data stored in it is consistent.

The first test method, `CanonicalTreeIsConsistent`, checks that the hash of each block in the blockchain is correct. It does this by iterating through the blockchain, starting from the latest block and working backwards, and checking that the hash of each block matches the parent hash of the previous block. If the hash of a block does not match the parent hash of the previous block, the test fails.

The second test method, `ParentTimestampIsAlwaysLowerThanChildTimestamp`, checks that the timestamp of each block in the blockchain is correct. It does this by iterating through the blockchain, starting from the latest block and working backwards, and checking that the timestamp of each block is greater than the timestamp of the previous block. If the timestamp of a block is not greater than the timestamp of the previous block, the test fails.

Both test methods use the `BlockForRpc` class to deserialize the JSON response from the Ethereum JSON-RPC API. The `BlockForRpc` class is a data transfer object that represents a block in the Ethereum blockchain. The `EthereumJsonSerializer` class is used to deserialize the JSON response into a `BlockForRpc` object.

These test methods are part of the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.Test` namespace and are used to test the `Nethermind` project. They are designed to be run as part of an automated test suite to ensure that the blockchain is functioning correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExternalRpcIntegrationTests` class?
- The `ExternalRpcIntegrationTests` class contains two test methods that check the consistency of the canonical tree and the ordering of timestamps in blocks obtained from an external RPC endpoint.

2. Why is the `BlockForRpcForTest` class defined as a nested class within `ExternalRpcIntegrationTests`?
- The `BlockForRpcForTest` class is defined as a nested class within `ExternalRpcIntegrationTests` because it is only used for testing purposes and is not intended to be part of the public API.

3. Why are the test methods marked with the `[Ignore]` attribute?
- The test methods are marked with the `[Ignore]` attribute because they require a specific RPC endpoint to be specified, which is not included in the code. This is likely done to prevent the tests from running accidentally and failing due to missing configuration.
