This code defines two event classes, `SortedPoolEventArgs` and `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs`, and declares two events, `Inserted` and `Removed`, within the `SortedPool` class. The purpose of these events is to allow other parts of the `Nethermind` project to subscribe to notifications when items are added to or removed from a sorted pool.

The `SortedPoolEventArgs` class contains three properties: `Key`, `Value`, and `Group`. These properties represent the key, value, and group of the item that was added to the pool. The `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` class inherits from `SortedPoolEventArgs` and adds a `bool` property `Evicted` to indicate whether the item was removed due to eviction.

The `Inserted` event is raised when a new item is added to the pool, and the `Removed` event is raised when an item is removed from the pool. Other parts of the `Nethermind` project can subscribe to these events to perform additional actions when items are added to or removed from the pool. For example, a module that tracks transaction status could subscribe to the `Removed` event to update its internal state when a transaction is removed from the pool.

Here is an example of how the `Inserted` event could be used:

```
var pool = new SortedPool<int, string, char>();
pool.Inserted += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Added item with key {args.Key}, value {args.Value}, and group {args.Group}");
};
pool.Add(1, "foo", 'A');
```

In this example, a new `SortedPool` is created with integer keys, string values, and character groups. A lambda expression is then attached to the `Inserted` event that simply writes the details of the added item to the console. Finally, an item with key `1`, value `"foo"`, and group `'A'` is added to the pool, which triggers the lambda expression to execute and print the details of the added item to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SortedPool` class and what are the generic type parameters `TKey`, `TValue`, and `TGroupKey` used for?
   - The `SortedPool` class is a collection class in the `Nethermind.TxPool.Collections` namespace. It is generic and takes three type parameters: `TKey` is the type of the keys, `TValue` is the type of the values, and `TGroupKey` is the type of the group keys.
2. What do the `Inserted` and `Removed` events do and when are they raised?
   - The `Inserted` event is raised when a new item is added to the `SortedPool` collection. The `Removed` event is raised when an item is removed from the collection. Both events are defined as `public` and take event arguments of different types.
3. What is the purpose of the `SortedPoolEventArgs` and `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` classes and what information do they contain?
   - The `SortedPoolEventArgs` class contains information about an item that was inserted into the `SortedPool` collection, including the key, value, and group key. The `SortedPoolRemovedEventArgs` class inherits from `SortedPoolEventArgs` and adds a `bool` property `Evicted` to indicate whether the item was removed due to eviction.
