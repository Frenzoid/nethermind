The code above defines a static class called `MemoryAllowance` that contains two public static properties: `MemPoolSize` and `TxHashCacheSize`. These properties are used to set the maximum size of the transaction pool and the transaction hash cache, respectively. 

The `MemPoolSize` property is set to a default value of 1 << 11, which is equivalent to 2048. This means that the transaction pool can hold up to 2048 transactions at a time. If the number of transactions in the pool exceeds this limit, new transactions will be rejected until there is space available.

The `TxHashCacheSize` property is set to a default value of 1 << 19, which is equivalent to 524288. This property determines the maximum number of transaction hashes that can be stored in the cache. The transaction hash cache is used to quickly check if a transaction has already been added to the pool. If the hash of a new transaction matches one that is already in the cache, the new transaction is rejected as a duplicate.

These properties can be modified by the user to adjust the memory allowance for the transaction pool and hash cache. For example, if the user wants to increase the maximum size of the transaction pool to 4096 transactions, they can set the `MemPoolSize` property to 1 << 12 (4096). 

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the Nethermind project, as it allows users to adjust the memory allowance for the transaction pool and hash cache to optimize performance and resource usage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a static class called `MemoryAllowance` with two properties that set the size of the memory pool and transaction hash cache for the Nethermind transaction pool.

2. What is the default value for `MemPoolSize` and `TxHashCacheSize`?
   The default value for `MemPoolSize` is 2048 (1 << 11) and the default value for `TxHashCacheSize` is 524288 (1 << 19).
