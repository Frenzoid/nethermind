The `HashCache` class is a thread-safe cache that prevents transactions from being analyzed multiple times. It has a two-layer structure, where transactions received many times within the same block will be ignored after the first check using the block cache. After a new chain head, the current block should be reset so that transactions can be analyzed again in case conditions changed (sender balance, basefee, etc.). The user is responsible for clearing the current block cache when the current block changes.

The `HashCache` class uses two instances of `LruKeyCache<ValueKeccak>` to store transaction hashes. The `_longTermCache` instance is used to store hashes that have been seen before, while the `_currentBlockCache` instance is used to store hashes that have been seen in the current block. The `SafeCapacity` constant is set to 1024 * 16, which is used as the maximum capacity for the `_currentBlockCache` instance. The `MemoryAllowance.TxHashCacheSize` constant is used as the maximum capacity for the `_longTermCache` instance, but it is capped at `SafeCapacity` if it is larger.

The `Get` method checks if a given hash exists in either the `_currentBlockCache` or `_longTermCache` instance and returns a boolean value indicating whether the hash exists.

The `SetLongTerm` method adds a given hash to the `_longTermCache` instance.

The `SetForCurrentBlock` method adds a given hash to the `_currentBlockCache` instance.

The `DeleteFromLongTerm` method removes a given hash from the `_longTermCache` instance.

The `Delete` method removes a given hash from both the `_longTermCache` and `_currentBlockCache` instances.

The `ClearCurrentBlockCache` method clears the `_currentBlockCache` instance.

Overall, the `HashCache` class is used to prevent duplicate transaction analysis in the transaction pool. It is used in the larger project to improve the performance of the transaction pool by reducing the number of duplicate transactions that need to be analyzed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a class called `HashCache` that is part of the `TxPool` namespace in the `nethermind` project. Its purpose is to prevent transactions from being analyzed multiple times by caching their hashes. It has a 2-layer structure and is thread safe.

2. What is the difference between the `_longTermCache` and `_currentBlockCache` variables?
- `_longTermCache` is a cache for transaction hashes that have been seen before, while `_currentBlockCache` is a cache for transaction hashes that have been seen within the current block. The former is used for long-term caching, while the latter is used for short-term caching.

3. What is the significance of the `MemoryAllowance` class?
- The `MemoryAllowance` class is not shown in this code snippet, but it is used to determine the size of the caches. Specifically, it is used to set the maximum size of the `_longTermCache` cache and to ensure that the size of the `_currentBlockCache` cache does not exceed a safe capacity.
