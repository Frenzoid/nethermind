This code defines a class called `CompareTxByGasLimit` that implements the `IComparer` interface for comparing `Transaction` objects. The purpose of this class is to provide a default ordering for transactions in a transaction pool based on their gas limit. Gas limit is an important parameter in Ethereum transactions that determines the maximum amount of gas that can be used to execute the transaction. 

The `CompareTxByGasLimit` class has a single public method called `Compare` that takes two `Transaction` objects as input and returns an integer value indicating their relative order. The method first checks if the two objects are equal or if one of them is null, and returns the appropriate value in those cases. If both objects are not null, the method compares their gas limits using the `GasLimit` property of the `Transaction` class. The comparison is done in ascending order, meaning that transactions with lower gas limits will be ordered first.

This class is part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `TxPool.Comparison` namespace. It can be used in various parts of the project where transactions need to be sorted based on their gas limit. For example, it can be used in the transaction pool implementation to order pending transactions before they are included in a block. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used to sort a list of transactions:

```
List<Transaction> transactions = GetTransactions();
transactions.Sort(CompareTxByGasLimit.Instance);
```

This code retrieves a list of transactions and sorts them using the `Sort` method of the `List` class, passing in an instance of the `CompareTxByGasLimit` class as the comparison function. This will order the transactions in the list based on their gas limit in ascending order.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `CompareTxByGasLimit` that implements the `IComparer` interface to provide a default ordering of transactions by their gas limit in ascending order.

2. What is the significance of the `Transaction` class from the `Nethermind.Core` namespace?
   - The `Transaction` class from the `Nethermind.Core` namespace is used in this code to compare transactions by their gas limit.

3. Why is the `CompareTxByGasLimit` constructor private?
   - The `CompareTxByGasLimit` constructor is private to enforce the use of the `Instance` field, which is a singleton instance of the class. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application.
