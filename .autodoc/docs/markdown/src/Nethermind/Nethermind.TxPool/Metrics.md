This code defines a static class called `Metrics` that contains a set of properties representing various metrics related to the transaction pool in the Nethermind project. These properties are decorated with custom attributes that provide additional information about the metrics, such as their type and description.

The `CounterMetric` attribute is used to mark properties that represent a count of some kind, such as the number of pending transactions sent or received. The `GaugeMetric` attribute is used to mark properties that represent a ratio or percentage, such as the ratio of 1559-type transactions in the block.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of tracking and reporting on various metrics related to the transaction pool. These metrics can be used to monitor the health and performance of the transaction pool, identify potential issues or bottlenecks, and optimize the behavior of the system.

For example, the `PendingTransactionsTooLowFee` property represents the number of pending transactions that were ignored because their fee was lower than the lowest fee in the transaction pool. This metric could be used to identify situations where the transaction pool is becoming congested with low-fee transactions, and take steps to encourage users to submit transactions with higher fees.

Here is an example of how one of these metrics might be accessed and used in the larger project:

```
long pendingTransactionsSent = Metrics.PendingTransactionsSent;
Console.WriteLine($"Number of pending transactions sent: {pendingTransactionsSent}");
```

This code retrieves the value of the `PendingTransactionsSent` property from the `Metrics` class and prints it to the console. This could be used, for example, to display real-time statistics about the transaction pool to users or administrators of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a static class called `Metrics` that contains various counter and gauge metrics related to pending transactions in a transaction pool.

2. What is the significance of the `CounterMetric` and `GaugeMetric` attributes?
   - The `CounterMetric` attribute indicates that the associated property is a counter metric, which means that its value is incremented or decremented based on certain events. The `GaugeMetric` attribute indicates that the associated property is a gauge metric, which means that its value represents a snapshot of a particular state at a given point in time.

3. What is the difference between the `PendingTransactionsTooLowFee` and `PendingTransactionsTooLowBalance` metrics?
   - The `PendingTransactionsTooLowFee` metric represents the number of pending transactions that were ignored because their fee was lower than the lowest fee in the transaction pool. The `PendingTransactionsTooLowBalance` metric represents the number of pending transactions that were ignored because their balance was too low for the fee to be higher than the lowest fee in the transaction pool.
