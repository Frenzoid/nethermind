The `FreeDiskSpaceCheckerTests` class is a test suite for the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker` class, which is responsible for checking the amount of free disk space available on a given drive. The purpose of this class is to ensure that the system has enough free disk space to operate correctly, and to take appropriate action if the amount of free space falls below a certain threshold.

The `FreeDiskSpaceCheckerTests` class contains two test methods: `free_disk_check_ensure_free_on_startup_no_wait` and `free_disk_check_ensure_free_on_startup_wait_until_enough`. Both methods take a float parameter `availableDiskSpacePercent`, which represents the percentage of disk space that is currently available on the drive being checked. The methods then create an instance of the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker` class, passing in a `HealthChecksConfig` object, a `LimboTraceLogger` instance, an array of `IDriveInfo` objects, and a `TimerFactory` instance.

The `HealthChecksConfig` object contains configuration settings for the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker`, including the `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` flag, which determines whether the system should wait for more free space to become available before starting up, and the `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold` and `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold` values, which determine the minimum amount of free space required for the system to operate correctly.

The `IDriveInfo` array contains information about the drive being checked, including the amount of free space available and the total size of the drive. The `LimboTraceLogger` instance is used for logging purposes, and the `TimerFactory` instance is used to create timers for the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker`.

The `free_disk_check_ensure_free_on_startup_no_wait` method tests the case where there is not enough free space available on the drive to start up the system. If the `exceptionExpected` parameter is `true`, the method expects a `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` to be thrown. If the parameter is `false`, the method expects the `EnsureEnoughFreeSpaceOnStart` method to complete without throwing an exception.

The `free_disk_check_ensure_free_on_startup_wait_until_enough` method tests the case where there is not enough free space available on the drive to start up the system, but the `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` flag is set to `true`, so the system waits for more free space to become available. The method creates a `Task` to run the `EnsureEnoughFreeSpaceOnStart` method, and then waits for the task to complete. If the `awaitsForFreeSpace` parameter is `true`, the method expects the `AvailableFreeSpace` property of the `IDriveInfo` object to be called three times. If the parameter is `false`, the method expects the property to be called once.

Overall, the `FreeDiskSpaceCheckerTests` class provides a suite of tests to ensure that the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker` class is working correctly. By testing different scenarios where there is not enough free space available on the drive, the tests help to ensure that the system can operate correctly under a variety of conditions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker` class and how is it used?
- The `FreeDiskSpaceChecker` class is used to check if there is enough free disk space on a drive. It takes in a `HealthChecksConfig` object, a logger, an array of `IDriveInfo` objects, a timer factory, and an optional timeout value. It has two methods, `EnsureEnoughFreeSpaceOnStart` and `EnsureEnoughFreeSpace`, which can be used to check for free disk space on startup and during runtime, respectively.

2. What is the purpose of the `HealthChecksConfig` object and what are its properties?
- The `HealthChecksConfig` object is used to configure the behavior of the `FreeDiskSpaceChecker`. It has three properties: `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup`, which determines whether to wait for free disk space on startup; `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold`, which determines the minimum percentage of free disk space required to avoid shutting down; and `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold`, which determines the minimum percentage of free disk space required to avoid a warning.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetDriveInfos` method and how is it used?
- The `GetDriveInfos` method is used to create an array of `IDriveInfo` objects, which are used to represent drives on the system. It takes in a `float` value representing the percentage of available disk space and returns an array containing a single `IDriveInfo` object. The `IDriveInfo` object is created using the `Substitute.For` method and its `AvailableFreeSpace`, `TotalSize`, and `RootDirectory.FullName` properties are set to predefined values.
