The `BlocksConfig` class is a configuration class that defines various properties related to blocks in the Nethermind project. It implements the `IBlocksConfig` interface, which defines the contract for block-related configuration properties. 

The class has several properties that can be used to configure the behavior of the Nethermind node. The `Enabled` property is a boolean that indicates whether the block-related configuration is enabled or not. The `TargetBlockGasLimit` property is a nullable long that specifies the target gas limit for blocks. The `MinGasPrice` property is a `UInt256` that specifies the minimum gas price for transactions. The `RandomizedBlocks` property is a boolean that indicates whether blocks should be randomized or not. The `SecondsPerSlot` property is an unsigned long that specifies the number of seconds per slot.

The `ExtraData` property is a string that represents extra data that can be included in blocks. The `GetExtraDataBytes` method returns the extra data as a byte array. The `ExtraData` property setter converts the string to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding and sets the `_extraDataBytes` field. If the byte array is longer than 32 bytes, an `InvalidConfigurationException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.

Overall, the `BlocksConfig` class provides a way to configure various block-related properties in the Nethermind node. It can be used to customize the behavior of the node to suit specific use cases. For example, the `TargetBlockGasLimit` property can be used to optimize the gas limit for a specific network, while the `ExtraData` property can be used to include custom data in blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlocksConfig` class?
    
    The `BlocksConfig` class is used to store configuration settings related to blocks in the Nethermind project, such as gas limits and block time.

2. What is the significance of the `ExtraData` property and how is it validated?
    
    The `ExtraData` property is a string that can be set to provide additional data to be included in a block's header. It is validated to ensure that the UTF-8 encoded byte array of the string is no longer than 32 bytes, and if it is, an `InvalidConfigurationException` is thrown.

3. What is the default value for `SecondsPerSlot` and what does it represent?
    
    The default value for `SecondsPerSlot` is 12, and it represents the number of seconds in each block slot. This value can be changed through the `BlocksConfig` class.
