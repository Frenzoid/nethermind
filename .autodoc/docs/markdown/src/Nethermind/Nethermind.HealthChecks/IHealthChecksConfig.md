The code defines an interface called `IHealthChecksConfig` that extends another interface called `IConfig`. This interface is used to configure various health checks related settings for the Nethermind project. 

The interface has several properties that can be set to configure the behavior of the health checks. These properties include `Enabled`, `WebhooksEnabled`, `Slug`, `WebhooksUri`, `WebhooksPayload`, `WebhooksRestorePayload`, `UIEnabled`, `PollingInterval`, `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock`, `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock`, `MaxIntervalClRequestTime`, `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold`, `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold`, and `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup`. 

For example, the `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether the health check endpoints are enabled at `/health`. The `WebhooksEnabled` property is another boolean that determines whether webhooks can be configured. The `Slug` property is a string that determines the URL slug on which the health checks service will be exposed. The `WebhooksUri` property is a string that determines the webhooks endpoint, such as Slack webhooks. The `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties are strings that contain JSON payloads that will be sent on failure and recovery, respectively. 

The `UIEnabled` property is a boolean that determines whether the health checks UI will be available at `/healthchecks-ui`. The `PollingInterval` property is an integer that configures the UI to poll for health checks updates in seconds. The `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock` and `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock` properties are ulongs that determine the maximum interval in seconds in which the node is assumed to be processing or producing blocks in a healthy way. The `MaxIntervalClRequestTime` property is an integer that determines the maximum request interval in which the CL works in a healthy way. 

Finally, the `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold`, `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold`, and `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` properties are floats and booleans that configure low storage space warnings and shutdowns. 

Overall, this interface is used to configure various health checks related settings for the Nethermind project, such as enabling/disabling health check endpoints, configuring webhooks, and configuring the health checks UI. Developers can use this interface to customize the behavior of the health checks system to suit their needs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an interface called `IHealthChecksConfig` that extends `IConfig` and contains properties related to health checks configuration.

2. What is the significance of the `ConfigItem` attribute used in this code?
   - The `ConfigItem` attribute is used to provide metadata about the properties in the `IHealthChecksConfig` interface, such as their default values and descriptions.

3. What are some examples of properties that can be configured using this interface?
   - Some examples of properties that can be configured using this interface include whether health check endpoints are enabled, whether webhooks can be configured, the URL slug on which the healthchecks service will be exposed, and the polling interval for healthchecks updates.
