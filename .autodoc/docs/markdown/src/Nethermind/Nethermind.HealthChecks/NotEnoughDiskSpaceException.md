This code defines a custom exception class called `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` that inherits from the `Exception` class and implements the `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface. The purpose of this exception is to be thrown when there is not enough disk space available for the Nethermind application to function properly. 

The `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface is used to associate an exit code with the exception. In this case, the `ExitCode` property returns the `LowDiskSpace` exit code defined in the `ExitCodes` class. This exit code can be used by the calling code to determine the appropriate action to take when this exception is thrown. 

This exception class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to handle situations where there is not enough disk space available for the application to operate. For example, if the application is trying to write data to disk and there is not enough space, this exception may be thrown to alert the calling code to take appropriate action, such as freeing up disk space or notifying the user. 

Here is an example of how this exception might be used in the Nethermind project:

```
try
{
    // code that writes data to disk
}
catch (NotEnoughDiskSpaceException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Not enough disk space available. Please free up space and try again.");
    Environment.Exit(ex.ExitCode);
}
``` 

In this example, if the `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` is thrown, the application will print a message to the console and exit with the `LowDiskSpace` exit code. This allows the calling code to handle the exception appropriately and take the necessary steps to ensure the application can continue to function properly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a custom exception class called `NotEnoughDiskSpaceException` that implements the `IExceptionWithExitCode` interface.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX` comments at the top of the file?
   - The `SPDX` comments indicate the copyright holder and license information for the code file.

3. What is the `ExitCodes` class and where is it defined?
   - The `ExitCodes` class is not defined in this code file, but it is likely defined in another file within the `Nethermind` project. It likely contains a list of exit codes that can be used to indicate specific error conditions.
