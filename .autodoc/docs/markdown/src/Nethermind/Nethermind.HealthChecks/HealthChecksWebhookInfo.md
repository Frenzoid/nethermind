The `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to provide useful information in health checks' webhook notifications. This class takes in four parameters: `description`, `ipResolver`, `metricsConfig`, and `hostname`. 

The `description` parameter is a string that describes the health check. The `ipResolver` parameter is an interface that resolves the external IP address of the node. The `metricsConfig` parameter is an interface that provides the node name. The `hostname` parameter is a string that represents the hostname of the node.

The constructor of the `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class initializes the private fields `_description`, `_hostname`, `_ip`, and `_nodeName`. The `_description` field is set to the `description` parameter. The `_hostname` field is set to the `hostname` parameter. The `_ip` field is set to the external IP address of the node resolved by the `ipResolver` parameter. The `_nodeName` field is set to the node name provided by the `metricsConfig` parameter.

The `GetFullInfo()` method returns a string that contains the health information of the node. The health information includes the `description`, `nodeName`, `hostname`, and `external IP address`. The health information is formatted using Markdown syntax.

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to provide health information about the node in webhook notifications. The `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` class can be instantiated with the appropriate parameters and the `GetFullInfo()` method can be called to get the health information of the node. This information can then be included in the webhook notifications to provide useful information to the users of the Nethermind project. 

Example usage:

```
IIPResolver ipResolver = new IPResolver();
IMetricsConfig metricsConfig = new MetricsConfig();
string hostname = "myhostname";
string description = "Node health check";

HealthChecksWebhookInfo healthInfo = new HealthChecksWebhookInfo(description, ipResolver, metricsConfig, hostname);
string fullInfo = healthInfo.GetFullInfo();

// Use the fullInfo string in webhook notifications
```

   - This code defines a class called `HealthChecksWebhookInfo` that provides information for health checks' webhook notifications, including the node name, hostname, and external IP address.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on the `Nethermind.Monitoring.Metrics`, `Nethermind.Monitoring.Config`, and `Nethermind.Network` namespaces, as well as the `System.Net` and `System` namespaces.

3. What is the format of the health information returned by the `GetFullInfo` method?
   - The health information returned by the `GetFullInfo` method is a string that includes the description of the health check, the node name, hostname, and external IP address, formatted as a Markdown code block.
