The `HealthChecksConfig` class is a configuration class that defines various properties related to health checks in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to configure the health checks feature in the project.

The class contains several properties that can be used to enable or disable certain features of the health checks. For example, the `Enabled` property can be used to enable or disable the health checks feature altogether. Similarly, the `WebhooksEnabled` property can be used to enable or disable the webhooks feature.

The `Slug` property defines the URL slug for the health checks endpoint. The `PollingInterval` property defines the interval at which the health checks are performed. The `WebhooksUri` property defines the URI for the webhook endpoint. The `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties define the payloads that are sent to the webhook endpoint when the health checks status changes.

The `UIEnabled` property can be used to enable or disable the health checks UI. The `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock` and `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock` properties define the maximum interval without a processed or produced block, respectively. The `MaxIntervalClRequestTime` property defines the maximum interval for a CL request time.

Finally, the `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold`, `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold`, and `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` properties define the thresholds for low storage space warnings and shutdowns, and whether to await on startup for low storage checks.

Overall, the `HealthChecksConfig` class provides a way to configure the health checks feature in the Nethermind project. By setting the various properties of this class, developers can customize the behavior of the health checks feature to suit their needs. For example, they can enable or disable certain features, set the polling interval, and define the thresholds for low storage space warnings and shutdowns.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `HealthChecksConfig` that implements an interface `IHealthChecksConfig` and contains properties related to health checks configuration.

2. What are the default values for the properties in this class?
    
    The default values for the properties in this class are: `Enabled` and `WebhooksEnabled` are `false`, `Slug` is `"/health"`, `PollingInterval` is `5`, `WebhooksUri` is `null`, `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` are JSON strings, `UIEnabled` is `false`, `MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock` and `MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock` are `null`, `MaxIntervalClRequestTime` is `300`, `LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold` is `5`, `LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold` is `1`, and `LowStorageCheckAwaitOnStartup` is `false`.

3. What is the purpose of the `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties?
    
    The `WebhooksPayload` and `WebhooksRestorePayload` properties contain JSON strings that define the payload for sending webhook notifications when a health check fails or recovers, respectively. The strings contain placeholders for `[[DESCRIPTIONS]]` and `[[LIVENESS]]` that will be replaced with actual values when the notifications are sent.
