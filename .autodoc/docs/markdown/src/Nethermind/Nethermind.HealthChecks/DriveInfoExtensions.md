This code defines a static class called `DriveInfoExtensions` that provides two extension methods for the `IDriveInfo` interface. The `IDriveInfo` interface is defined in the `System.IO.Abstractions` namespace and is used to abstract away the underlying file system implementation, allowing for easier testing and mocking.

The first extension method, `GetFreeSpacePercentage`, calculates the percentage of free space on the drive represented by the `IDriveInfo` object. It does this by dividing the `AvailableFreeSpace` property by the `TotalSize` property and multiplying the result by 100. The result is returned as a `double`.

The second extension method, `GetFreeSpaceInGiB`, calculates the amount of free space on the drive represented by the `IDriveInfo` object in gibibytes (GiB). It does this by dividing the `AvailableFreeSpace` property by the value of `1.GiB()`, which is a extension method defined in the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace that returns the value of 1 gibibyte in bytes as a `long`. The result is returned as a `double`.

These extension methods can be used to easily retrieve information about the free space on a drive without having to perform the calculations manually. They can be used in any part of the codebase that has access to an `IDriveInfo` object, such as in health checks or monitoring tools that need to keep track of disk usage. For example, the `GetFreeSpacePercentage` method could be used to trigger an alert if the free space on a drive falls below a certain threshold, while the `GetFreeSpaceInGiB` method could be used to display the amount of free space in a user interface.
