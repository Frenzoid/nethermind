This code defines an interface called `IIPSource` that is used to retrieve an IP address. The interface has a single method called `TryGetIP()` that returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the IP address retrieval was successful and the retrieved IP address as an `IPAddress` object.

This interface is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to retrieve the IP address of a node in the network. This could be useful for various purposes such as establishing connections between nodes or for monitoring the network.

An example implementation of this interface could be a class that retrieves the IP address from a DNS server. Another implementation could be a class that retrieves the IP address from a configuration file.

Overall, this code serves as a foundation for retrieving IP addresses in the Nethermind network and allows for flexibility in how the IP address is retrieved.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines an interface called `IIPSource` for obtaining an IP address.

2. What is the expected behavior of the `TryGetIP()` method?
   - The `TryGetIP()` method is expected to return a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the IP address was successfully obtained, and the IP address itself.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
