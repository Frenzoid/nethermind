The `NetworkNodeDecoder` class is responsible for decoding and encoding `NetworkNode` objects to and from RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) format. RLP is a serialization format used in Ethereum to encode data structures for storage or transmission on the network. 

The `NetworkNode` class represents a node on the Ethereum network and contains information such as the node's public key, IP address, port number, and reputation. The `NetworkNodeDecoder` class implements the `IRlpStreamDecoder` and `IRlpObjectDecoder` interfaces to provide methods for decoding and encoding `NetworkNode` objects.

The `Decode` method takes an `RlpStream` object and reads the RLP-encoded data to create a new `NetworkNode` object. The method first reads the length of the RLP sequence, then decodes the public key, IP address, port number, and reputation from the RLP-encoded data. If the IP address is an empty string, it is set to null. The method then creates a new `NetworkNode` object with the decoded data and returns it.

The `Encode` methods take a `NetworkNode` object and encode it to RLP format. The `Encode` method that returns an `Rlp` object creates a new `RlpStream` object, encodes the `NetworkNode` object to the stream, and returns an `Rlp` object containing the encoded data. The other `Encode` method writes the encoded data to a `MemoryStream` object, but this method is not implemented and will throw a `NotImplementedException`.

The `GetLength` and `GetContentLength` methods are used to calculate the length of the RLP-encoded data. `GetContentLength` calculates the length of the content of the RLP sequence, while `GetLength` calculates the total length of the RLP sequence including the length prefix.

The static constructor of the `NetworkNodeDecoder` class registers an instance of the class with the `Rlp.Decoders` dictionary to allow RLP-encoded data to be decoded into `NetworkNode` objects.

Overall, the `NetworkNodeDecoder` class is an important component of the Ethereum network stack, allowing `NetworkNode` objects to be serialized and deserialized for storage and transmission on the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NetworkNodeDecoder` class?
    
    The `NetworkNodeDecoder` class is responsible for decoding and encoding `NetworkNode` objects using RLP serialization.

2. What is the significance of the `Rlp.Decoders[typeof(NetworkNode)] = new NetworkNodeDecoder();` line of code?
    
    This line of code registers the `NetworkNodeDecoder` class as the decoder for `NetworkNode` objects with the RLP serialization library.

3. What is the purpose of the `Encode` methods in the `NetworkNodeDecoder` class?
    
    The `Encode` methods are responsible for encoding `NetworkNode` objects using RLP serialization. There are three different `Encode` methods that take different types of output streams (a `RlpStream`, a `MemoryStream`, or no stream at all and simply return a `Rlp` object).
