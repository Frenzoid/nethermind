The `CompositeNodeSource` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to combine multiple `INodeSource` instances into a single source. The purpose of this class is to provide a unified view of multiple node sources, allowing the caller to treat them as a single source. 

The class implements the `INodeSource` interface, which defines methods for loading a list of nodes and events for when nodes are added or removed. The `LoadInitialList` method returns a list of all nodes from all the sources that were passed to the constructor. This is achieved by iterating over each source and calling its `LoadInitialList` method, then adding the resulting nodes to a list. The resulting list is then returned to the caller.

The class also defines two events, `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved`, which are raised when a node is added or removed from any of the sources. These events are implemented by subscribing to the corresponding events of each source passed to the constructor. When a node is added or removed from any of the sources, the corresponding event is raised by the source, and the `CompositeNodeSource` instance raises its own event, passing along the event arguments from the source.

Here is an example of how the `CompositeNodeSource` class can be used:

```csharp
var source1 = new MyNodeSource1();
var source2 = new MyNodeSource2();
var compositeSource = new CompositeNodeSource(source1, source2);

var nodes = compositeSource.LoadInitialList();
foreach (var node in nodes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(node.ToString());
}

compositeSource.NodeAdded += (sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Node added: {e.Node}");
};

compositeSource.NodeRemoved += (sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Node removed: {e.Node}");
};
```

In this example, two custom node sources (`MyNodeSource1` and `MyNodeSource2`) are created and passed to a `CompositeNodeSource` instance. The `LoadInitialList` method is called to retrieve a list of all nodes from both sources, which is then printed to the console. The `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events are also subscribed to, so any nodes added or removed from either source will be printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `CompositeNodeSource` that implements the `INodeSource` interface and provides a way to load a list of nodes from multiple sources.

2. What other classes or interfaces does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on the `INodeSource` interface and the `Node` and `NodeEventArgs` classes from the `Nethermind.Stats.Model` namespace.

3. What events does the `CompositeNodeSource` class raise and how are they handled?
   - The `CompositeNodeSource` class raises two events: `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved`. These events are handled by invoking the corresponding event handlers for each of the `INodeSource` objects that were passed to the constructor.
