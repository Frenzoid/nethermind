The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for removing the snap capability after the SnapSync process is finished. This class is part of the Nethermind project and is located in the `Nethermind.Network` namespace. The purpose of this class is to add the Snap capability to the `IProtocolsManager` and remove it after the SnapSync process is finished.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has three private fields: `_protocolsManager`, `_syncModeSelector`, and `_logger`. The `_protocolsManager` field is an instance of the `IProtocolsManager` interface, which manages the protocols used by the P2P network. The `_syncModeSelector` field is an instance of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface, which selects the synchronization mode used by the node. The `_logger` field is an instance of the `ILogger` interface, which logs messages.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a constructor that takes three optional parameters: `protocolsManager`, `syncModeSelector`, and `logManager`. If any of these parameters are null, an `ArgumentNullException` is thrown. The constructor initializes the private fields with the provided parameters.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a public method called `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced()`. This method adds the Snap capability to the `IProtocolsManager` and registers an event handler for the `Changed` event of the `ISyncModeSelector`. If the logger is in debug mode, it logs a message indicating that the Snap capability has been enabled.

The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class has a private method called `OnSyncModeChanged()`. This method is called when the `Changed` event of the `ISyncModeSelector` is raised. If the current synchronization mode is `SyncMode.Full`, the Snap capability is removed from the `IProtocolsManager`, and the event handler is unregistered. If the logger is in info mode, it logs a message indicating that the Snap capability has been disabled.

In summary, the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for adding and removing the Snap capability from the `IProtocolsManager` during the SnapSync process. It is used to manage the protocols used by the P2P network and select the synchronization mode used by the node. This class is part of the larger Nethermind project and is located in the `Nethermind.Network` namespace.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class?
    
    The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class is a temporary class used for removing snap capability after SnapSync finish and will be removed after implementing missing functionality - serving data via snap protocol.

2. What are the dependencies of the `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class?
    
    The `SnapCapabilitySwitcher` class depends on `IProtocolsManager`, `ISyncModeSelector`, and `ILogManager`.

3. What does the `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced` method do?
    
    The `EnableSnapCapabilityUntilSynced` method adds Snap capability if SnapSync is not finished and removes it after finished. It also subscribes to the `Changed` event of `_syncModeSelector` and logs a debug message if `_logger.IsDebug` is true.
