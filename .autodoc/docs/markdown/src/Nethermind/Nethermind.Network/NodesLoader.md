The `NodesLoader` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for loading and managing nodes in the network. It implements the `INodeSource` interface, which defines the methods for loading and managing nodes. 

The `NodesLoader` class has a constructor that takes in several dependencies, including `INetworkConfig`, `INodeStatsManager`, `INetworkStorage`, `IRlpxHost`, and `ILogManager`. These dependencies are used to load and manage nodes in the network. 

The `LoadInitialList` method is responsible for loading the initial list of nodes. It first loads the peers from the database using the `LoadPeersFromDb` method. It then loads the boot nodes and static nodes from the configuration using the `LoadConfigPeers` method. Finally, it filters out the local node and the non-static nodes if the `OnlyStaticPeers` configuration is set to true. 

The `LoadPeersFromDb` method loads the persisted nodes from the database and adds them to the list of peers. It also updates the node statistics using the `INodeStatsManager` dependency. 

The `LoadConfigPeers` method loads the nodes from the configuration and adds them to the list of peers. It also updates the node properties, such as `IsBootnode` and `IsStatic`, based on the type of node. 

The `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events are not implemented in this class and are just empty implementations of the `INodeSource` interface. 

Overall, the `NodesLoader` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it manages the nodes in the network. It loads the nodes from the database and configuration and updates their properties based on their type. It also filters out the local node and non-static nodes if required.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodesLoader` class?
    
    The `NodesLoader` class is responsible for loading and managing a list of network nodes for the Nethermind project.

2. What are the parameters passed to the constructor of the `NodesLoader` class?
    
    The `NodesLoader` class constructor takes in several parameters including `INetworkConfig`, `INodeStatsManager`, `INetworkStorage`, `IRlpxHost`, and `ILogManager`.

3. What is the purpose of the `LoadInitialList` method?
    
    The `LoadInitialList` method is responsible for loading a list of network nodes by calling `LoadPeersFromDb` and `LoadConfigPeers` methods, and then filtering the list based on certain conditions before returning it.
