The `ForkId` struct is a simple data structure that represents a fork identifier in the Nethermind project. A fork is a change to the Ethereum protocol that is not backwards-compatible, and the `ForkId` struct is used to uniquely identify a specific fork.

The `ForkId` struct has two properties: `ForkHash` and `Next`. `ForkHash` is a 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the hash of the fork block. `Next` is a 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the block number at which the fork takes effect.

The `HashBytes` property is a getter that returns the `ForkHash` property as a byte array in big-endian format. This is useful for serialization and deserialization of the `ForkId` struct.

The `Equals` method is used to compare two `ForkId` instances for equality. Two `ForkId` instances are considered equal if their `ForkHash` and `Next` properties are equal.

The `GetHashCode` method is used to generate a hash code for the `ForkId` instance. It combines the hash codes of the `ForkHash` and `Next` properties using the `HashCode.Combine` method.

The `ToString` method returns a string representation of the `ForkId` instance. It returns the `ForkHash` property as a hex string, followed by a space, followed by the `Next` property.

Overall, the `ForkId` struct is a simple data structure that is used to uniquely identify a fork in the Nethermind project. It provides methods for serialization, deserialization, comparison, and string representation of fork identifiers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ForkId` struct and how is it used in the `Nethermind.Network` namespace?
- The `ForkId` struct represents a fork in the Ethereum network and is used in the `Nethermind.Network` namespace to identify and track forks.
2. Why is the `HashBytes` property returning a byte array of length 4?
- The `HashBytes` property is returning a byte array of length 4 because it is using the `BinaryPrimitives.TryWriteUInt32BigEndian` method to write the `ForkHash` value as a 32-bit unsigned integer in big-endian byte order, which results in a 4-byte array.
3. How is the `GetHashCode` method implemented for the `ForkId` struct?
- The `GetHashCode` method for the `ForkId` struct is implemented by combining the hash codes of the `ForkHash` and `Next` properties using the `HashCode.Combine` method.
