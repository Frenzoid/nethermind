The `HelloMessage` class is a part of the `nethermind` project and is used in the P2P (peer-to-peer) network communication protocol. This class represents a message that is sent when a node connects to another node in the network. The purpose of this message is to introduce the connecting node to the network and provide information about its capabilities.

The `HelloMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all P2P messages in the `nethermind` project. The `HelloMessage` class has several properties that are used to provide information about the connecting node. These properties include:

- `P2PVersion`: A byte that represents the version of the P2P protocol that the connecting node is using.
- `ClientId`: A string that represents the client software that the connecting node is using.
- `ListenPort`: An integer that represents the port number that the connecting node is listening on.
- `NodeId`: A `PublicKey` object that represents the public key of the connecting node.
- `Capabilities`: A list of `Capability` objects that represent the capabilities of the connecting node.

The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `HelloMessage` object. This method returns a string that includes the `ClientId` and a comma-separated list of the `Capabilities`.

This class is used in the larger `nethermind` project to facilitate communication between nodes in the P2P network. When a node connects to another node, it sends a `HelloMessage` to introduce itself and provide information about its capabilities. The receiving node can then use this information to determine how to communicate with the connecting node. For example, if the connecting node has a capability for a specific feature, the receiving node can use that feature when communicating with the connecting node.

Here is an example of how the `HelloMessage` class might be used in the `nethermind` project:

```
HelloMessage helloMessage = new HelloMessage();
helloMessage.P2PVersion = 1;
helloMessage.ClientId = "MyClient";
helloMessage.ListenPort = 30303;
helloMessage.NodeId = new PublicKey("0x1234567890abcdef");
helloMessage.Capabilities = new List<Capability>() { new Capability("eth", 63) };

// Send the hello message to another node in the network
network.Send(helloMessage);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    - This code file defines a class called `HelloMessage` which represents a P2P message used in the Nethermind network.

2. What properties does the `HelloMessage` class have?
    - The `HelloMessage` class has properties for `P2PVersion`, `ClientId`, `ListenPort`, `NodeId`, and `Capabilities`.

3. What is the format of the `ToString()` method for `HelloMessage`?
    - The `ToString()` method for `HelloMessage` returns a string in the format of "Hello(ClientId, Capabilities)" where `ClientId` is the value of the `ClientId` property and `Capabilities` is a comma-separated list of the values in the `Capabilities` property.
