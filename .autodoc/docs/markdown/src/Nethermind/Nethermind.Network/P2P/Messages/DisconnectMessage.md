The code above defines a class called `DisconnectMessage` that inherits from the `P2PMessage` class. This class is used to represent a message that can be sent over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to signal that a node wishes to disconnect from another node. 

The `DisconnectMessage` class has two constructors, one that takes a `DisconnectReason` enum as an argument and another that takes an integer. These constructors set the `Reason` property of the `DisconnectMessage` object to the value of the argument passed in. The `Reason` property is an integer that represents the reason for the disconnection. 

The `DisconnectMessage` class also overrides two properties of the `P2PMessage` class. The `Protocol` property is set to `"p2p"`, indicating that this message is intended for a P2P network. The `PacketType` property is set to `P2PMessageCode.Disconnect`, which is an integer code that represents the type of message. 

Finally, the `DisconnectMessage` class overrides the `ToString()` method to return a string representation of the message that includes the reason for the disconnection. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to facilitate communication between nodes in a P2P network. When a node wishes to disconnect from another node, it can create a `DisconnectMessage` object and send it to the other node. The receiving node can then use the `Reason` property to determine why the disconnection occurred. 

Example usage:

```
DisconnectMessage message = new DisconnectMessage(DisconnectReason.Timeout);
network.Send(message);
``` 

In this example, a `DisconnectMessage` object is created with a `DisconnectReason` of `Timeout` and sent over the `network`. The receiving node can then use the `Reason` property to determine that the disconnection was due to a timeout.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectMessage` class?
   - The `DisconnectMessage` class is a subclass of `P2PMessage` and represents a message used to disconnect from a peer in the P2P network.

2. What is the significance of the `DisconnectReason` parameter in the constructor?
   - The `DisconnectReason` parameter is used to set the `Reason` property of the `DisconnectMessage` instance, which indicates the reason for the disconnection.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `ToString()` method for a `DisconnectMessage` instance?
   - The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the `DisconnectMessage` instance, including the value of the `Reason` property.
