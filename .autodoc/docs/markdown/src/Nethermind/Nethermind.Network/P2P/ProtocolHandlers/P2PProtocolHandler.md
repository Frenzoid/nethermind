The `P2PProtocolHandler` class is a protocol handler for the P2P (peer-to-peer) network layer of the Nethermind client. It is responsible for handling incoming and outgoing messages, managing protocol initialization, and maintaining a list of supported and agreed-upon capabilities.

The class implements the `IP2PProtocolHandler` interface, which defines methods for sending and receiving P2P messages, and the `IPingSender` interface, which defines a method for sending ping messages. It also extends the `ProtocolHandlerBase` class, which provides a base implementation for protocol handlers.

The `P2PProtocolHandler` class maintains a list of supported capabilities, which are represented as `Capability` objects. A capability is a feature or protocol that a node supports, and is identified by a protocol code and a version number. The class also maintains a list of agreed-upon capabilities, which are negotiated during the protocol initialization process.

The `P2PProtocolHandler` class implements the `Init` method, which sends a hello message to the remote node and waits for a hello message in response. The hello message contains information about the local node, including its node ID, client ID, and supported capabilities. Once the hello message is received, the class initializes subprotocols in alphabetical order based on the agreed-upon capabilities.

The class also implements the `HandleMessage` method, which handles incoming messages based on their message code. The supported message codes include hello, disconnect, ping, pong, and add capability messages. The class responds to ping messages with pong messages, and sends disconnect messages to close the connection.

The `P2PProtocolHandler` class provides methods for checking whether a capability is available or agreed-upon, and for adding a supported capability. It also provides properties for accessing the listen port, local node ID, and remote client ID.

Overall, the `P2PProtocolHandler` class is a key component of the Nethermind client's P2P network layer, responsible for managing protocol initialization and message handling. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for supporting different P2P protocols and capabilities.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `P2PProtocolHandler` class?
- The `P2PProtocolHandler` class is a protocol handler for the P2P network layer in the Nethermind project. It handles messages such as hello, ping, pong, and disconnect, and manages capabilities and subprotocols.

2. What is the significance of the `SupportedCapabilities` and `DefaultCapabilities` lists?
- The `SupportedCapabilities` list contains the capabilities that the local node supports, while the `DefaultCapabilities` list contains the default capabilities that are always supported. When a hello message is received, the `P2PProtocolHandler` checks the capabilities of the remote node against the supported capabilities to determine which capabilities can be used for the session.

3. What is the purpose of the `_pongCompletionSource` field and the `SendPing` method?
- The `_pongCompletionSource` field is a `TaskCompletionSource` that is used to signal when a pong message is received in response to a ping message. The `SendPing` method sends a ping message and waits for a pong message to be received within a timeout period. If a pong message is received, the method returns true, otherwise it returns false.
