The `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class is a tool for diagnosing network disconnections in the Nethermind project. It is designed to report on the reasons for disconnections and provide insight into the frequency of these events. 

The class uses a timer to periodically report on the disconnects that have occurred since the last report. The timer is set to 10 seconds by default, but can be overridden using the `WithIntervalOverride` method. When the timer elapses, the class creates a local copy of the disconnects dictionary, switches to a new dictionary to start collecting new disconnects, and then reports on the disconnects in the local copy. 

The disconnects are stored in two concurrent dictionaries, `_disconnectsA` and `_disconnectsB`, which are swapped each time the timer elapses. This allows the class to continue collecting disconnects while the report is being generated. 

The disconnects are stored as a `DisconnectCategory` struct, which contains a `DisconnectReason` and a `DisconnectType`. The `ReportDisconnect` method is used to add new disconnects to the dictionary. If the disconnect type is `Local`, the method also logs the details of the disconnect using the logger. 

The class is designed to be used as part of the larger Nethermind project to help diagnose network issues. It can be used to identify patterns in the types and reasons for disconnections, which can help developers to identify and fix bugs in the network code. 

Example usage:

```csharp
var disconnectsAnalyzer = new DisconnectsAnalyzer(logManager);
disconnectsAnalyzer.ReportDisconnect(DisconnectReason.Timeout, DisconnectType.Remote, null);
disconnectsAnalyzer.ReportDisconnect(DisconnectReason.ProtocolError, DisconnectType.Local, "Invalid message received");
disconnectsAnalyzer.WithIntervalOverride(5000);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class?
    
    The `DisconnectsAnalyzer` class is created to help diagnose network disconnections.

2. What is the significance of the `DisconnectCategory` struct?
    
    The `DisconnectCategory` struct is used to group disconnect reasons by reason and type.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReportDisconnect` method?
    
    The `ReportDisconnect` method is used to report a network disconnection with the given reason, type, and details. It increments the disconnect count and adds the disconnect to the appropriate `ConcurrentDictionary`. If the disconnect type is local and details are not null, it logs a warning message.
