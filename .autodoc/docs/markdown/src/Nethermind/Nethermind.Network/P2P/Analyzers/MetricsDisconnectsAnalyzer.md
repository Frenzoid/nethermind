The `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is used to analyze and report disconnects in the P2P network. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the different types of disconnects that occur in the network and report them to the `Metrics` class. 

The `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` class implements the `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` interface, which requires the implementation of the `ReportDisconnect` method. This method takes in three parameters: `reason`, `type`, and `details`. The `reason` parameter is an enum that represents the reason for the disconnect, while the `type` parameter is an enum that represents whether the disconnect was initiated locally or remotely. The `details` parameter is a string that provides additional information about the disconnect.

The `ReportDisconnect` method first checks whether the disconnect was initiated remotely or locally. If the disconnect was initiated remotely, the method uses a switch statement to determine the reason for the disconnect and increments the corresponding counter in the `Metrics` class. Similarly, if the disconnect was initiated locally, the method uses another switch statement to determine the reason for the disconnect and increments the corresponding counter in the `Metrics` class.

The `Metrics` class is not shown in this code snippet, but it is likely that it is used to keep track of the different types of disconnects that occur in the network. The `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` class is likely used in conjunction with other classes in the `Nethermind` project to monitor and analyze the P2P network.

Here is an example of how the `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` class might be used in the `Nethermind` project:

```csharp
var analyzer = new MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer();
analyzer.ReportDisconnect(DisconnectReason.BreachOfProtocol, DisconnectType.Remote, "Peer violated protocol");
```

In this example, a new instance of the `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` class is created, and the `ReportDisconnect` method is called with the `DisconnectReason.BreachOfProtocol` enum value, the `DisconnectType.Remote` enum value, and a string that provides additional details about the disconnect. This call will increment the `Metrics.BreachOfProtocolDisconnects` counter in the `Metrics` class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `MetricsDisconnectsAnalyzer` that implements the `IDisconnectsAnalyzer` interface. It provides a method called `ReportDisconnect` that updates various metrics based on the reason and type of a disconnection event.

2. What is the `DisconnectReason` enum used for?
    
    The `DisconnectReason` enum is used to specify the reason for a disconnection event. It is used in the `ReportDisconnect` method to determine which metric to update based on the reason for the disconnection.

3. What is the `DisconnectType` enum used for?
    
    The `DisconnectType` enum is used to specify whether a disconnection event was initiated locally or remotely. It is used in the `ReportDisconnect` method to determine which metric to update based on the type of the disconnection.
