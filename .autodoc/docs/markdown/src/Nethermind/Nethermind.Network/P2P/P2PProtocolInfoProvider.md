The `P2PProtocolInfoProvider` class is a utility class that provides two static methods for working with P2P protocols in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to provide information about the highest version of the Eth protocol and to convert the default capabilities of the P2P protocol handler to a string.

The `GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol` method iterates over the default capabilities of the `P2PProtocolHandler` and returns the highest version number of the Eth protocol. This method is useful for determining the highest version of the Eth protocol that is supported by the Nethermind node.

The `DefaultCapabilitiesToString` method converts the default capabilities of the `P2PProtocolHandler` to a string. This method orders the capabilities by protocol code and then by version number in descending order. The resulting string is a comma-separated list of protocol codes and version numbers. This method is useful for logging and debugging purposes.

Here is an example of how these methods can be used:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Network.P2P;

int highestVersion = P2PProtocolInfoProvider.GetHighestVersionOfEthProtocol();
string capabilitiesString = P2PProtocolInfoProvider.DefaultCapabilitiesToString();

Console.WriteLine($"Highest Eth protocol version: {highestVersion}");
Console.WriteLine($"Default capabilities: {capabilitiesString}");
```

This code will output the highest Eth protocol version and the default capabilities of the P2P protocol handler. This information can be used to ensure that the Nethermind node is using the correct version of the Eth protocol and to debug any issues related to P2P protocol handling.
