The `BlockHeadersMessage` class is a part of the `nethermind` project and is used in the P2P subprotocol for Ethereum version 62. This class represents a message that contains an array of `BlockHeader` objects. 

The purpose of this class is to allow nodes to exchange block headers with each other. Block headers are a part of the Ethereum blockchain and contain important information about a block, such as its hash, timestamp, and difficulty. By exchanging block headers, nodes can synchronize their view of the blockchain without having to download the entire blockchain.

The `BlockHeadersMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class, which is a base class for all P2P messages in the `nethermind` project. It overrides two properties, `PacketType` and `Protocol`, which are used to identify the type of message and the protocol it belongs to. The `PacketType` property is set to `Eth62MessageCode.BlockHeaders`, which is a predefined code for block header messages in the Ethereum version 62 subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `"eth"`, which indicates that this message belongs to the Ethereum protocol.

The `BlockHeadersMessage` class has two constructors. The default constructor does not take any arguments and initializes the `BlockHeaders` property to an empty array. The second constructor takes an array of `BlockHeader` objects as an argument and initializes the `BlockHeaders` property to that array.

The `BlockHeaders` property is a public property that allows access to the array of `BlockHeader` objects contained in the message. This property can be used to read or modify the block headers in the message.

The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `BlockHeadersMessage` object. It returns a string that includes the name of the class and the length of the `BlockHeaders` array.

Overall, the `BlockHeadersMessage` class is an important part of the P2P subprotocol for Ethereum version 62 in the `nethermind` project. It allows nodes to exchange block headers with each other, which is an essential part of blockchain synchronization.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `BlockHeadersMessage` that represents a P2P message for sending block headers in the Ethereum network.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
   The `PacketType` property specifies the code for this message type in the Ethereum 62 protocol, while the `Protocol` property specifies the name of the protocol.

3. What is the `BlockHeaders` property and how is it used?
   The `BlockHeaders` property is an array of `BlockHeader` objects that represent the headers of Ethereum blocks. It is used to store the block headers that are being sent or received in the P2P message.
