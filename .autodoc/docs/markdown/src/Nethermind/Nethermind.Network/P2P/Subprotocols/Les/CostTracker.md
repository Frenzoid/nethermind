The `CostTracker` class in the `Les` subprotocol of the `Nethermind` project is responsible for tracking the cost of various requests made by the client to the server. The cost of a request is determined by the amount of bandwidth and CPU time required to fulfill the request. The `CostTracker` class defines a default cost table for various types of requests, which is used as a starting point for calculating the cost of a request.

The `DefaultRequestCostTable` is a static array of `RequestCostItem` objects, where each object represents the cost of a specific type of request. The `RequestCostItem` class has three properties: `MessageCode`, `BandwidthCost`, and `CpuCost`. The `MessageCode` property is an enum that represents the type of request, and the `BandwidthCost` and `CpuCost` properties represent the cost of the request in terms of bandwidth and CPU time, respectively.

The default cost table is based on the values used by the `geth` client, but it is expected that the client will supply its own values for the cost of requests. The `CostTracker` class provides hooks for the client to supply its own cost table, as well as to implement cost scaling to account for users with different capabilities.

The `CostTracker` class is an important component of the `Les` subprotocol, as it ensures that the client is aware of the cost of requests and can make informed decisions about which requests to make. It also provides a mechanism for the client to optimize its requests based on the available bandwidth and CPU time.

Example usage:

```csharp
// Get the cost of a GetBlockHeaders request
var blockHeadersCost = CostTracker.DefaultRequestCostTable
    .FirstOrDefault(c => c.MessageCode == LesMessageCode.GetBlockHeaders);

// Use the cost to make a decision about whether to make the request
if (blockHeadersCost.BandwidthCost < availableBandwidth && blockHeadersCost.CpuCost < availableCpu)
{
    // Make the request
}
else
{
    // Do not make the request
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CostTracker` class?
    
    The `CostTracker` class is used to define the default cost table for various requests in the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind network.

2. What are the TODOs mentioned in the code comments?
    
    The TODOs mentioned in the code comments are to benchmark the finished implementation and update the cost values based on actual server times, implement cost scaling to account for users with different capabilities, and implement multiple cost lists to limit based on minimum available bandwidth, CPU time, etc.

3. What is the purpose of the `DefaultRequestCostTable` array?
    
    The `DefaultRequestCostTable` array is used to define the default cost values for various requests in the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind network.
