[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Snap/Messages/TrieNodesMessage.cs)

The code defines a class called `TrieNodesMessage` which is a subclass of `SnapMessageBase`. This class is used to represent a message in the Snap subprotocol of the Nethermind network's P2P layer. The purpose of this message is to transmit a set of trie nodes over the network.

The `TrieNodesMessage` class has a constructor that takes an optional parameter `data` which is an array of byte arrays. If `data` is null, it is replaced with an empty array. The `Nodes` property is a public getter and setter for this array.

The `PacketType` property is an integer that represents the type of the message. In this case, it is set to `SnapMessageCode.TrieNodes`, which is a constant defined elsewhere in the codebase.

This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Snap subprotocol to transmit trie nodes between nodes in the Nethermind network. For example, a node might receive a `TrieNodesMessage` from another node, deserialize the message, and use the trie nodes to update its own trie data structure.

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```csharp
// create an array of trie nodes
byte[][] nodes = new byte[][]
{
    new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 },
    new byte[] { 0x04, 0x05, 0x06 },
    new byte[] { 0x07, 0x08, 0x09 }
};

// create a new TrieNodesMessage with the array of nodes
TrieNodesMessage message = new TrieNodesMessage(nodes);

// send the message over the network
network.Send(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   This code file defines a class called `TrieNodesMessage` which is a subprotocol message for the Snap protocol in the Nethermind network's P2P layer.

2. What is the significance of the `Nodes` property being set to `data ?? Array.Empty<byte[]>()` in the constructor?
   This sets the `Nodes` property to the value of `data` if it is not null, otherwise it sets it to an empty array of byte arrays. This ensures that the `Nodes` property is never null.

3. What is the `PacketType` property used for?
   The `PacketType` property is an integer value that represents the type of message being sent over the Snap protocol. In this case, it is set to the value of `SnapMessageCode.TrieNodes`, indicating that this message contains trie nodes.
