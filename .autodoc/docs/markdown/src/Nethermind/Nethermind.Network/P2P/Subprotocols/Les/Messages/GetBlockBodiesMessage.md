The code defines a class called `GetBlockBodiesMessage` which is a message used in the `Les` subprotocol of the `P2P` network in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this message is to request the bodies of one or more blocks from a peer node in the network. 

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is set to `LesMessageCode.GetBlockBodies`, which is a code that identifies this message type within the `Les` subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`, which is the protocol used by the `Les` subprotocol.

The class has two public properties: `RequestId` and `EthMessage`. `RequestId` is a long integer that uniquely identifies the request within the `Les` subprotocol. `EthMessage` is an instance of the `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` class, which contains the details of the block bodies being requested.

The class has two constructors. The default constructor takes no arguments and does nothing. The second constructor takes an instance of `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage` and a `long` integer as arguments, and initializes the `EthMessage` and `RequestId` properties with these values.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate communication between nodes in the `P2P` network. When a node wants to request the bodies of one or more blocks from a peer node, it creates an instance of `GetBlockBodiesMessage` with the appropriate `EthMessage` and `RequestId` values, and sends it to the peer node using the `Les` subprotocol. The peer node can then respond with a `BlockBodiesMessage` containing the requested block bodies.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetBlockBodiesMessage` class?
   - The `GetBlockBodiesMessage` class is a subprotocol message used in the Nethermind network's P2P communication to request block bodies.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
   - The `PacketType` property specifies the code for the `GetBlockBodiesMessage` message type, while the `Protocol` property specifies the P2P protocol used for the message (in this case, "Les").

3. What is the purpose of the `RequestId` and `EthMessage` properties?
   - The `RequestId` property is used to identify the request associated with the `GetBlockBodiesMessage`, while the `EthMessage` property contains the actual message data (in this case, an `Eth.V62.Messages.GetBlockBodiesMessage`).
