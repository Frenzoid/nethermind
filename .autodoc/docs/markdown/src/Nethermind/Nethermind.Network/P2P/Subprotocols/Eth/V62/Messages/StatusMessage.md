The `StatusMessage` class is a part of the `nethermind` project and is used in the P2P subprotocol for Ethereum version 62. The purpose of this class is to define a message that can be sent between nodes in the Ethereum network to share information about the current state of the network.

The `StatusMessage` class contains several properties that represent different pieces of information about the network. These properties include `ProtocolVersion`, `NetworkId`, `TotalDifficulty`, `BestHash`, `GenesisHash`, and `ForkId`. 

- `ProtocolVersion` represents the version of the Ethereum protocol being used.
- `NetworkId` represents the unique identifier for the network.
- `TotalDifficulty` represents the total difficulty of the blockchain.
- `BestHash` represents the hash of the current best block in the blockchain.
- `GenesisHash` represents the hash of the genesis block.
- `ForkId` represents the ID of the current fork.

The `StatusMessage` class also overrides two properties from the `P2PMessage` class: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. `PacketType` is set to `Eth62MessageCode.Status`, which is a predefined code for the `StatusMessage` message type. `Protocol` is set to `"eth"`, which indicates that this message is part of the Ethereum protocol.

Finally, the `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `StatusMessage` object. This method returns a formatted string that includes the values of the different properties of the `StatusMessage` object.

This class can be used in the larger `nethermind` project to facilitate communication between nodes in the Ethereum network. When a node receives a `StatusMessage` from another node, it can use the information contained in the message to update its own view of the network. For example, a node can use the `TotalDifficulty` property to determine which chain is the longest and therefore the most valid. The `BestHash` property can be used to request missing blocks from other nodes. The `ForkId` property can be used to determine whether the node is on the correct fork of the blockchain. Overall, the `StatusMessage` class is an important component of the P2P subprotocol for Ethereum version 62 in the `nethermind` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a class called `StatusMessage` which represents a P2P message for the Ethereum v62 subprotocol.

2. What properties does the `StatusMessage` class have?
   - The `StatusMessage` class has properties for the protocol version, network ID, total difficulty, best hash, genesis hash, and fork ID.

3. What is the format of the `ToString()` output for a `StatusMessage` object?
   - The `ToString()` method returns a string that includes the protocol version, network ID, total difficulty, best hash (if present), genesis hash (if present), and fork ID (if present) of the `StatusMessage` object.
