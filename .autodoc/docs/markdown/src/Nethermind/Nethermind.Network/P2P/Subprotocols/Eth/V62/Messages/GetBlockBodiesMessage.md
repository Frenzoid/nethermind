The `GetBlockBodiesMessage` class is a message type used in the Ethereum subprotocol of the Nethermind project's P2P network. This message is used to request the block bodies (i.e. the transaction data) for a list of blocks identified by their hashes.

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides its `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties to specify the message code and protocol for this message type. The `BlockHashes` property is an `IReadOnlyList` of `Keccak` objects, which represent the hashes of the blocks whose transaction data is being requested.

The class provides two constructors: one that takes an `IReadOnlyList` of `Keccak` objects and one that takes a variable number of `Keccak` objects. The latter constructor simply calls the former with the provided arguments cast to an `IReadOnlyList`.

The `ToString` method is overridden to return a string representation of the message type and the number of block hashes in the `BlockHashes` list.

This message type is likely used in the larger project to facilitate the synchronization of transaction data between nodes in the Ethereum network. When a node receives a `GetBlockBodiesMessage`, it will respond with a `BlockBodiesMessage` containing the requested transaction data. This message type is one of several message types used in the Ethereum subprotocol of the Nethermind project's P2P network to facilitate communication between nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class called `GetBlockBodiesMessage` which is a P2P message used in the Ethereum subprotocol. It contains a list of block hashes and is used to request the bodies of those blocks.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` type and where is it defined?
   - The `Keccak` type is used as the type of the elements in the `BlockHashes` list. It is likely defined in the `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespace, which is imported at the top of the file.

3. What version of the Ethereum subprotocol is this code for?
   - This code is for version 62 of the Ethereum subprotocol, as indicated by the `Eth62MessageCode.GetBlockBodies` value assigned to the `PacketType` property.
