The code defines a static class called `LesMessageCode` that contains constants representing message codes for the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) network protocol. The LES protocol is used to exchange data between Ethereum nodes, specifically for light clients that do not store the entire blockchain.

Each constant in the `LesMessageCode` class represents a specific message code that can be sent or received by a node using the LES protocol. For example, the `Status` constant represents the message code for a status message, which is sent by a node to announce its current state and capabilities to other nodes. Similarly, the `Announce` constant represents the message code for an announce message, which is sent by a node to advertise a new block or transaction.

The other constants in the class represent various types of messages that can be exchanged between nodes using the LES protocol, such as `GetBlockHeaders`, `BlockHeaders`, `GetBlockBodies`, `BlockBodies`, `GetReceipts`, `Receipts`, `GetContractCodes`, `ContractCodes`, `GetProofsV2`, `ProofsV2`, `GetHelperTrieProofs`, `HelperTrieProofs`, `SendTxV2`, `GetTxStatus`, `TxStatus`, `Stop`, and `Resume`.

These message codes are used by nodes to communicate with each other and exchange data related to the Ethereum blockchain. For example, a node may send a `GetBlockHeaders` message to request a list of block headers from another node, or a `SendTxV2` message to broadcast a new transaction to the network.

Overall, this code is an important part of the LES protocol implementation in the Nethermind project, as it defines the message codes that nodes use to communicate with each other and exchange data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a static class `LesMessageCode` that contains constants representing message codes for the LES subprotocol in the Nethermind network.

2. What is the significance of the deprecated message codes?
- The deprecated message codes (`GetProofs`, `Proofs`, `SendTx`, `GetHeaderProofs`, and `HeaderProofs`) are no longer used in the LES subprotocol and have been replaced by newer versions (`GetProofsV2`, `ProofsV2`, and `SendTxV2`).

3. How are these message codes used in the Nethermind network?
- These message codes are used to identify and differentiate between different types of messages sent between nodes in the Nethermind network that use the LES subprotocol. For example, a node may send a `Status` message to announce its current state, or a `GetBlockHeaders` message to request block headers from another node.
