The `LesProtocolHandler` class is a subprotocol handler for the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) protocol. It is responsible for handling messages related to block synchronization and data retrieval. The class implements the `ISyncPeer` interface, which defines methods for retrieving block headers and notifying peers of new blocks.

The `LesProtocolHandler` class initializes the LES protocol by sending a `StatusMessage` to the peer. The `StatusMessage` contains information about the current state of the node, including the protocol version, network ID, and head block hash. The class also handles incoming messages, including `GetBlockHeadersMessage`, `GetBlockBodiesMessage`, `GetReceiptsMessage`, `GetContractCodesMessage`, and `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage`. These messages are used to request block headers, block bodies, receipts, contract codes, and helper trie proofs from the peer.

The `LesProtocolHandler` class also implements the `NotifyOfNewBlock` method, which is called when a new block is added to the blockchain. This method sends an `AnnounceMessage` to the peer, which contains information about the new block, including the block hash, block number, and total difficulty. The `AnnounceMessage` is used by the peer to update its view of the blockchain.

Overall, the `LesProtocolHandler` class is an important component of the Nethermind project, as it provides the functionality for synchronizing blocks and data between nodes in the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LesProtocolHandler` class?
- The `LesProtocolHandler` class is a subprotocol handler for the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) protocol used in Ethereum network communication.

2. What is the significance of the `StatusMessage` class and how is it used in the `LesProtocolHandler`?
- The `StatusMessage` class is used to exchange status information between peers during LES protocol initialization. It contains information such as the protocol version, network ID, best block hash, and total difficulty. In the `LesProtocolHandler`, the `Handle` method is used to process incoming `StatusMessage` instances and initialize the protocol accordingly.

3. What is the purpose of the `NotifyOfNewBlock` method in the `LesProtocolHandler`?
- The `NotifyOfNewBlock` method is used to send block announcements to LES peers that have requested them. It constructs an `AnnounceMessage` instance containing information about the new block, such as its hash, block number, and total difficulty, and sends it to the peer. The `AnnounceMessage` allows the peer to update its view of the blockchain and stay in sync with the network.
