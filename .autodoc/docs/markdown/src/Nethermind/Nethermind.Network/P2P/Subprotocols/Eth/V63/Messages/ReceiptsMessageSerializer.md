The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing `ReceiptsMessage` objects, which are used in the Ethereum P2P subprotocol version 63. The purpose of this class is to convert `ReceiptsMessage` objects into a byte stream that can be sent over the network, and to convert byte streams back into `ReceiptsMessage` objects.

The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class implements the `IZeroInnerMessageSerializer` interface, which requires the implementation of three methods: `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, and `GetLength`. The `Serialize` method takes a `ReceiptsMessage` object and a `IByteBuffer` object, and writes the serialized byte stream to the `IByteBuffer`. The `Deserialize` method takes a `IByteBuffer` object and returns a `ReceiptsMessage` object. The `GetLength` method returns the length of the serialized byte stream.

The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class uses the `NettyRlpStream` class to serialize and deserialize `ReceiptsMessage` objects. The `NettyRlpStream` class is a wrapper around the `RlpStream` class, which is used to encode and decode Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoded data. RLP is a serialization format used in Ethereum to encode data structures such as transactions, blocks, and receipts.

The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class also uses the `ReceiptMessageDecoder` class to encode and decode `TxReceipt` objects. The `TxReceipt` class represents a transaction receipt, which contains information about the execution of a transaction. The `ReceiptMessageDecoder` class decodes `TxReceipt` objects from RLP encoded data, and encodes `TxReceipt` objects into RLP encoded data.

The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class uses the `ISpecProvider` interface to get the Ethereum specification for a given block number. The Ethereum specification defines the rules for validating transactions, blocks, and receipts. The `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class uses the Ethereum specification to determine which RLP encoding rules to use when encoding and decoding `TxReceipt` objects.

Overall, the `ReceiptsMessageSerializer` class is an important component of the Ethereum P2P subprotocol version 63, as it enables the serialization and deserialization of `ReceiptsMessage` objects, which are used to communicate transaction receipt information between Ethereum nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code is a message serializer for the ReceiptsMessage class in the Ethereum P2P subprotocol. It serializes and deserializes transaction receipts data for Ethereum nodes to communicate with each other efficiently.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several external libraries, including DotNetty.Buffers, Nethermind.Core, Nethermind.Core.Extensions, Nethermind.Core.Specs, and Nethermind.Serialization.Rlp.

3. What is the significance of the comment about the allocation of Goerli 3m fast sync?
   - The comment indicates that this code is responsible for allocating 3% (2GB) of memory for the Goerli test network's fast sync feature. It also suggests that there may be room for improvement in the implementation of the ZeroMessageSerializer.
