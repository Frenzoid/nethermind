The `Eth65ProtocolHandler` class is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P network. It is responsible for handling messages related to pooled transactions, which are transactions that have been submitted to the network but have not yet been included in a block. 

The class inherits from `Eth64ProtocolHandler` and overrides some of its methods. It takes in several dependencies, including an `IPooledTxsRequestor` which is used to request transactions from other nodes in the network. 

The `HandleMessage` method is called when a message is received from the network. It first calls the base implementation of `HandleMessage` to handle any messages that are not specific to the `Eth65` protocol. It then switches on the message type and calls the appropriate method to handle the message. 

The `Handle` method is called when a `PooledTransactionsMessage` is received. It deserializes the message and calls the `_pooledTxsRequestor` to request the transactions from other nodes. 

The `FulfillPooledTransactionsRequest` method is called when a `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` is received. It retrieves the requested transactions from the transaction pool and creates a `PooledTransactionsMessage` to send back to the requesting node. 

The `SendNewTransactionsCore` method is called when new transactions are added to the transaction pool. If `sendFullTx` is true, it calls the base implementation of `SendNewTransactionsCore` to send the full transaction data to other nodes. Otherwise, it creates a `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage` containing the transaction hashes and sends it to other nodes. 

Overall, the `Eth65ProtocolHandler` class is an important component of the Ethereum P2P network that handles messages related to pooled transactions. It allows nodes to request and share information about transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the Eth65ProtocolHandler class, which is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P network.

2. What is the difference between Eth65ProtocolHandler and Eth64ProtocolHandler?
- Eth65ProtocolHandler is a subclass of Eth64ProtocolHandler and adds support for new features introduced in Ethereum protocol version 65, such as pooled transactions.

3. What is the role of IPooledTxsRequestor and how is it used in this code?
- IPooledTxsRequestor is an interface that provides a way to request pooled transactions from other nodes in the network. In this code, the _pooledTxsRequestor field is used to request transactions in the Handle(NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage) method.
