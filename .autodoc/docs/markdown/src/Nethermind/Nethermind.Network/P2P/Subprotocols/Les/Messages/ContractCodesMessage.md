The `ContractCodesMessage` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the P2P subprotocol Les. This class represents a message that is sent between nodes in the Ethereum network to request contract codes. 

The `ContractCodesMessage` class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is set to `LesMessageCode.ContractCodes`, which is a constant value that represents the type of message being sent. The `Protocol` property is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`, which is a constant value that represents the subprotocol being used.

The `ContractCodesMessage` class has three public properties: `RequestId`, `BufferValue`, and `Codes`. The `RequestId` property is a long value that represents the unique identifier for the request being made. The `BufferValue` property is an integer value that represents the size of the buffer used to store the contract codes. The `Codes` property is an array of byte arrays that represents the contract codes being requested.

The `ContractCodesMessage` class has two constructors. The default constructor takes no arguments and does not initialize any of the properties. The second constructor takes three arguments: `codes`, `requestId`, and `bufferValue`. These arguments are used to initialize the `Codes`, `RequestId`, and `BufferValue` properties, respectively.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate communication between nodes in the Ethereum network. When a node wants to request contract codes from another node, it creates a `ContractCodesMessage` object and sets the `Codes`, `RequestId`, and `BufferValue` properties to the appropriate values. It then sends this message to the other node using the P2P subprotocol Les. The receiving node can then use the information in the message to retrieve the requested contract codes and send them back to the requesting node.

Example usage:

```
// create a ContractCodesMessage object
byte[][] codes = new byte[][] { new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02 }, new byte[] { 0x03, 0x04 } };
long requestId = 123456789;
int bufferValue = 1024;
ContractCodesMessage message = new ContractCodesMessage(codes, requestId, bufferValue);

// send the message to another node
// (code for sending the message is not shown)
```

In this example, a `ContractCodesMessage` object is created with two contract codes, a request ID of 123456789, and a buffer value of 1024. This message can then be sent to another node in the Ethereum network using the P2P subprotocol Les.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `ContractCodesMessage` which represents a message for the LES subprotocol of the Nethermind P2P network. 

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
- The `PacketType` property specifies the type of message within the LES subprotocol, and the `Protocol` property specifies the name of the subprotocol itself. 

3. What is the purpose of the `Codes`, `RequestId`, and `BufferValue` properties?
- The `Codes` property is an array of byte arrays representing contract codes, the `RequestId` property is a unique identifier for the message, and the `BufferValue` property is an integer representing the size of the buffer used to transmit the message.
