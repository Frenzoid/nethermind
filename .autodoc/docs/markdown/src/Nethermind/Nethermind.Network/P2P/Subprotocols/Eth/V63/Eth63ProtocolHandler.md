The `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P protocol. It extends the `Eth62ProtocolHandler` class and implements the `IEthProtocolHandler` interface. The class is responsible for handling messages related to the Ethereum protocol version 63.

The class contains two message queues, `_nodeDataRequests` and `_receiptsRequests`, which are used to handle requests for node data and receipts, respectively. The `GetNodeData` and `GetReceipts` methods are used to send requests for node data and receipts, respectively. These methods create instances of `GetNodeDataMessage` and `GetReceiptsMessage` and pass them to the appropriate message queue for processing.

The `HandleMessage` method is responsible for handling incoming messages. It first calls the base implementation of the method to handle messages related to the Ethereum protocol version 62. It then reads the size of the message and switches on the message type to handle the message appropriately. The message types handled are `GetReceipts`, `Receipts`, `GetNodeData`, and `NodeData`.

The `Handle` method is called when a `Receipts` message is received. It extracts the transaction receipts from the message and passes them to the `_receiptsRequests` message queue for processing.

The `FulfillNodeDataRequest` method is called when a `GetNodeData` message is received. It retrieves the requested node data from the `SyncServer` and returns it in a `NodeDataMessage`.

The `Handle` method is called when a `NodeData` message is received. It extracts the node data from the message and passes it to the `_nodeDataRequests` message queue for processing.

The `SendRequest` methods are used to send requests for node data and receipts. They take a message and a cancellation token as input and return the requested data. They use the appropriate message queue to send the request and wait for a response.

Overall, the `Eth63ProtocolHandler` class is an important component of the Ethereum P2P protocol implementation in the Nethermind project. It provides functionality for requesting and handling node data and receipts, which are essential for synchronizing with the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the Eth63ProtocolHandler class, which is a subprotocol handler for the Ethereum P2P network.

2. What other classes does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several other classes from the Nethermind library, including ISession, IMessageSerializationService, INodeStatsManager, ISyncServer, ITxPool, IGossipPolicy, and ILogManager.

3. What are the main differences between Eth62ProtocolHandler and Eth63ProtocolHandler?
- Eth63ProtocolHandler inherits from Eth62ProtocolHandler and adds support for handling GetNodeDataMessage and NodeDataMessage messages, in addition to GetReceiptsMessage and ReceiptsMessage messages. It also overrides the ProtocolVersion and MessageIdSpaceSize properties, and adds new methods for handling node data requests.
