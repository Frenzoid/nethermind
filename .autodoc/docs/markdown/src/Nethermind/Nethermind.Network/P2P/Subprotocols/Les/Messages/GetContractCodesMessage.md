The `GetContractCodesMessage` class is a message type used in the `nethermind` project's P2P subprotocol for Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES). This message is used to request the bytecode of one or more smart contracts from a remote node on the Ethereum network.

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is set to `LesMessageCode.GetContractCodes`, which is a unique identifier for this type of message in the LES subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`, which specifies that this message is part of the LES subprotocol.

The `GetContractCodesMessage` class has two public properties: `RequestId` and `Requests`. `RequestId` is a unique identifier for this request, and `Requests` is an array of `CodeRequest` objects. Each `CodeRequest` object represents a request for the bytecode of a specific smart contract. The `CodeRequest` class is not defined in this file, but it likely contains information such as the address of the contract and any additional parameters needed to retrieve its bytecode.

The `GetContractCodesMessage` class also has a public property called `RequestAddresses`, which is an array of `Keccak` objects. This property is a convenience method that returns an array of the `AccountKey` properties of each `CodeRequest` object in the `Requests` array. The `AccountKey` property is likely the address of the smart contract being requested.

This message type is used in the larger `nethermind` project to facilitate communication between nodes on the Ethereum network. When a node receives a `GetContractCodesMessage`, it will retrieve the bytecode for each requested smart contract and send a `ContractCodesMessage` back to the requesting node with the bytecode for each contract. The requesting node can then use this bytecode to interact with the smart contracts on the network.

Example usage:

```csharp
// create an array of CodeRequest objects
CodeRequest[] requests = new CodeRequest[]
{
    new CodeRequest { AccountKey = new Keccak("0x123...") },
    new CodeRequest { AccountKey = new Keccak("0x456...") }
};

// create a new GetContractCodesMessage with the requests and a unique request ID
GetContractCodesMessage message = new GetContractCodesMessage(requests, 12345);

// send the message to a remote node on the Ethereum network
myP2PClient.SendMessage(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `GetContractCodesMessage` which represents a P2P message for requesting contract codes.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
- The `PacketType` property specifies the code for this particular type of P2P message, while the `Protocol` property specifies the protocol used for this message (in this case, the LES protocol).

3. What is the purpose of the `RequestAddresses` property?
- The `RequestAddresses` property returns an array of `Keccak` hashes, which represent the account keys for the contract codes being requested in this message.
