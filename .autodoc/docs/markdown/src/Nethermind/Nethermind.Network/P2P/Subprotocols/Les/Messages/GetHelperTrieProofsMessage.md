This code defines a class called `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` that inherits from the `P2PMessage` class. The purpose of this class is to represent a message that can be sent over the P2P network using the LES subprotocol. 

The LES subprotocol is used for light client support in Ethereum. Light clients are nodes that do not store the entire blockchain but instead rely on other nodes to provide them with the necessary information to verify transactions and blocks. The LES subprotocol provides a way for light clients to request specific information from full nodes on the network. 

The `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class represents a message that a light client can send to a full node to request proof data for a set of trie nodes. Tries are data structures used in Ethereum to store account and contract state information. The `Requests` property of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class is an array of `HelperTrieRequest` objects, which specify the trie nodes for which the light client is requesting proof data. 

The `PacketType` property of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class is set to `LesMessageCode.GetHelperTrieProofs`, which is a code that identifies this message type within the LES subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `Contract.P2P.Protocol.Les`, which specifies that this message is part of the LES subprotocol. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the LES subprotocol implementation in the Nethermind project. It allows light clients to request proof data for trie nodes from full nodes on the network, which is essential for light client support in Ethereum. 

Example usage:

```csharp
var message = new GetHelperTrieProofsMessage
{
    RequestId = 123,
    Requests = new[] { new HelperTrieRequest("0x1234"), new HelperTrieRequest("0x5678") }
};

// send message over P2P network using LES subprotocol
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class?
   - The `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class is a P2P subprotocol message used to request helper trie proofs.

2. What is the significance of the `PacketType` and `Protocol` properties?
   - The `PacketType` property specifies the message code for the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage`, while the `Protocol` property specifies the P2P protocol used for the message (in this case, Les).

3. What is the `HelperTrieRequest` type and how is it used in this class?
   - The `HelperTrieRequest` type is an array of requests for helper trie proofs, and it is used as a property of the `GetHelperTrieProofsMessage` class to specify the requests being made.
