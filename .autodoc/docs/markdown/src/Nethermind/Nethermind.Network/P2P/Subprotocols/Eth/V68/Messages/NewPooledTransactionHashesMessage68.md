The `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage68` class is a message type used in the Ethereum subprotocol of the Nethermind network stack. It represents a message containing a list of transaction hashes that have been added to the transaction pool of a node. 

The message contains three lists: `Types`, `Sizes`, and `Hashes`. `Types` is a list of bytes representing the transaction types (e.g. 0x00 for a regular transaction, 0x01 for a contract creation). `Sizes` is a list of integers representing the sizes of the transactions in bytes. `Hashes` is a list of `Keccak` objects representing the transaction hashes.

The `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage68` class has a constant `MaxCount` which is set to 2048. This is the maximum number of transaction hashes that can be included in a single message. This limit is set to ensure that the message size does not exceed 102400 bytes, which is the maximum message size used by Geth and Nethermind.

This message type is used to notify other nodes in the network of new transactions that have been added to the transaction pool. When a node receives this message, it can update its own transaction pool with the new transactions. This helps to ensure that all nodes in the network have an up-to-date view of the current state of the transaction pool.

An example of how this message type might be used in the larger project is in the implementation of the Ethereum peer-to-peer networking layer. When a node receives a new transaction, it adds it to its own transaction pool and broadcasts a `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage68` to its peers to notify them of the new transaction. Peers that receive this message can then update their own transaction pools accordingly. This helps to ensure that all nodes in the network have a consistent view of the current state of the transaction pool.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
    
    This code defines a message class for the Ethereum P2P subprotocol that allows for the transmission of transaction hashes. It solves the problem of efficiently broadcasting transaction information across the network.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxCount` constant and how was it determined?
    
    The `MaxCount` constant specifies the maximum number of transaction hashes that can be included in a single message without exceeding the maximum message size of 102400 bytes. It was determined to be 2048 based on the size of the hash, type, and length data for each transaction.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToString()` method in this class?
    
    The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the message class that includes the number of transaction hashes it contains. This can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
