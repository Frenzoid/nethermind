The `NewBlockHashesMessage` class is a part of the `nethermind` project and is used in the P2P subprotocol for Ethereum version 62. The purpose of this class is to define a message that can be sent between nodes in the Ethereum network to share information about new block hashes. 

The class inherits from the `P2PMessage` class and overrides two of its properties: `PacketType` and `Protocol`. The `PacketType` property is set to `Eth62MessageCode.NewBlockHashes`, which is a code that identifies this message type within the Ethereum version 62 subprotocol. The `Protocol` property is set to `"eth"`, which indicates that this message is part of the Ethereum protocol.

The `NewBlockHashesMessage` class also has a public property called `BlockHashes`, which is an array of tuples containing a `Keccak` hash and a `long` value. These tuples represent the hashes of new blocks that have been added to the blockchain. The `Keccak` class is defined in the `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespace and is used to compute the Keccak-256 hash of a byte array.

The constructor for the `NewBlockHashesMessage` class takes a variable number of arguments, each of which is a tuple containing a block hash and a block number. These arguments are used to initialize the `BlockHashes` property.

Finally, the `ToString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `NewBlockHashesMessage` object. This method returns a string that includes the name of the class and the length of the `BlockHashes` array.

Overall, the `NewBlockHashesMessage` class is an important part of the Ethereum version 62 subprotocol in the `nethermind` project. It allows nodes in the network to share information about new block hashes, which is essential for maintaining consensus and ensuring the integrity of the blockchain. An example of how this class might be used in the larger project is in the implementation of a block propagation algorithm, where nodes broadcast new block hashes to their peers to facilitate the propagation of new blocks throughout the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a message class for the Ethereum v62 subprotocol of the Nethermind P2P network, specifically for sending new block hashes.

2. What is the significance of the Keccak and long types used in this code?
   Keccak is a cryptographic hash function used in Ethereum, and long is a data type for storing large integers. In this code, they are used together to represent a block hash and its associated block number.
