The `Peer` class is a representation of a connection state with another node in the P2P network. It contains information about the node, as well as incoming and outgoing sessions to that node. 

The `Node` property is an instance of the `Node` class, which represents a physical network node with a network address combined with information about the client version and any extra attributes that we assign to a network node (static / trusted / bootnode). 

The `InSession` and `OutSession` properties represent incoming and outgoing sessions to the node, respectively. These sessions can be in one of many states. 

The `IsAwaitingConnection` property is a boolean that indicates whether the peer is currently awaiting a connection. 

The purpose of this class is to manage connections between nodes in the P2P network. Because peers are actively searching for each other and initializing connections, it may happen that two peers will simultaneously connect and we will have both incoming and outgoing connections to the same network node. In such cases, the sessions are managed by disconnecting one of the sessions and keeping the other. The logic for choosing which session to drop has to be consistent between the two peers - we use the PublicKey comparison to choose the connection direction in the same way on both sides. 

This class is used in the larger project to facilitate communication between nodes in the P2P network. For example, it may be used to establish and manage connections between nodes for the purpose of sharing data or verifying transactions. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new node
Node myNode = new Node("192.168.0.1", "myClientVersion", NodeAttributes.Static);

// create a new peer for the node
Peer myPeer = new Peer(myNode);

// establish an outgoing session to the node
myPeer.OutSession = new MySession(myNode);

// print the peer information
Console.WriteLine(myPeer.ToString());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Peer` class?
    
    The `Peer` class represents a connection state with another node of the P2P network and manages sessions between the two peers.

2. What is the significance of the `IsAwaitingConnection` property?
    
    The `IsAwaitingConnection` property is not used in the code provided, but it could potentially be used to indicate whether the peer is currently waiting for a connection to be established.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToString()` method in the `Peer` class?
    
    The `ToString()` method returns a string representation of the `Peer` object, including information about the associated `Node` and `InSession` and `OutSession` properties. This can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
