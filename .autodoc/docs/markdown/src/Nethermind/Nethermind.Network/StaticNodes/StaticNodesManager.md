The `StaticNodesManager` class is responsible for managing a list of static nodes that can be used to connect to the Ethereum network. Static nodes are nodes that are pre-defined and do not change, unlike dynamic nodes that are discovered at runtime. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to manage a list of static nodes that can be used by the client to connect to the network.

The class uses a `ConcurrentDictionary` to store the list of nodes, where the key is the `PublicKey` of the node and the value is the `NetworkNode` object that represents the node. The `Nodes` property returns an `IEnumerable` of `NetworkNode` objects that represent the list of nodes.

The `InitAsync` method is responsible for initializing the list of nodes from a file. The file is read asynchronously, and the contents are parsed to extract the list of nodes. The list of nodes is then added to the `ConcurrentDictionary`. If the file does not exist, the method returns without doing anything.

The `AddAsync` and `RemoveAsync` methods are used to add and remove nodes from the list. The `AddAsync` method takes an `enode` string that represents the node to be added. The method creates a new `NetworkNode` object from the `enode` string and adds it to the `ConcurrentDictionary`. If the node already exists in the dictionary, the method returns `false`. If the node is added successfully, the `NodeAdded` event is raised. The `RemoveAsync` method works in a similar way, but removes the node from the dictionary instead of adding it.

The `IsStatic` method is used to check if a given `enode` string represents a static node. The method creates a new `NetworkNode` object from the `enode` string and checks if it exists in the `ConcurrentDictionary`.

The `SaveFileAsync` method is used to save the list of nodes to a file. The method serializes the list of `NetworkNode` objects to a JSON string and writes it to a file.

The `LoadInitialList` method is used to load the initial list of nodes. The method returns a list of `Node` objects that represent the list of nodes.

Overall, the `StaticNodesManager` class provides a way to manage a list of static nodes that can be used to connect to the Ethereum network. The class can be used by the client to add, remove, and check if a node is a static node. The class also provides events that can be used to notify the client when a node is added or removed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StaticNodesManager` class?
- The `StaticNodesManager` class is responsible for managing a list of static nodes, which are nodes that are manually added to the network configuration and do not change frequently.

2. What is the format of the data that is loaded from the static nodes file?
- The data can be either a JSON array of strings or a newline-separated list of strings. If the data is in JSON format, it will be deserialized into an array of strings.

3. What events can be subscribed to in the `StaticNodesManager` class?
- The `NodeAdded` and `NodeRemoved` events can be subscribed to in the `StaticNodesManager` class. These events are raised when a node is added or removed from the list of static nodes.
