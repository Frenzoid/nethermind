The `NetworkConfig` class is a configuration object that holds various properties related to network configuration for the Nethermind project. It implements the `INetworkConfig` interface, which defines the contract for network configuration in the project.

The properties in the class include `ExternalIp`, `LocalIp`, `StaticPeers`, and `DiscoveryDns`, which are all related to network connectivity and discovery. `OnlyStaticPeers` and `IsPeersPersistenceOn` are boolean flags that control whether the node should only connect to static peers and whether peer persistence is enabled, respectively.

The class also includes various integer properties that control the behavior of the peer-to-peer network, such as `MaxActivePeers`, `PriorityPeersMaxCount`, `PeersPersistenceInterval`, `PeersUpdateInterval`, and `P2PPingInterval`. These properties control the maximum number of active peers, the interval at which peers are persisted to disk, and the interval at which peers are updated, among other things.

Other properties in the class include `MaxPersistedPeerCount`, `PersistedPeerCountCleanupThreshold`, `MaxCandidatePeerCount`, and `CandidatePeerCountCleanupThreshold`, which are related to peer persistence and cleanup.

Finally, the class includes properties related to network performance and debugging, such as `DiagTracerEnabled`, `NettyArenaOrder`, `MaxNettyArenaCount`, `Bootnodes`, `EnableUPnP`, `DiscoveryPort`, `P2PPort`, and `SimulateSendLatencyMs`.

Overall, the `NetworkConfig` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's network infrastructure, as it provides a centralized location for configuring various network-related properties. Developers can use this class to customize the behavior of the network to suit their needs. For example, they can set the `MaxActivePeers` property to limit the number of active peers their node connects to, or they can set the `DiscoveryPort` property to change the port used for peer discovery.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `NetworkConfig` that implements the `INetworkConfig` interface.

2. What properties does the `NetworkConfig` class have?
- The `NetworkConfig` class has several properties, including `ExternalIp`, `LocalIp`, `StaticPeers`, `DiscoveryDns`, `OnlyStaticPeers`, `IsPeersPersistenceOn`, `MaxActivePeers`, `PriorityPeersMaxCount`, `PeersPersistenceInterval`, `PeersUpdateInterval`, `P2PPingInterval`, `MaxPersistedPeerCount`, `PersistedPeerCountCleanupThreshold`, `MaxCandidatePeerCount`, `CandidatePeerCountCleanupThreshold`, `DiagTracerEnabled`, `NettyArenaOrder`, `MaxNettyArenaCount`, `Bootnodes`, `EnableUPnP`, `DiscoveryPort`, `P2PPort`, and `SimulateSendLatencyMs`.

3. What is the purpose of the `[Obsolete]` attribute on the `ActivePeersMaxCount` property?
- The `[Obsolete]` attribute indicates that the `ActivePeersMaxCount` property is no longer recommended to be used and has been replaced by the `MaxActivePeers` property.
