The `SocketClient` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to handle socket communication between clients. It implements the `ISocketsClient` interface and provides methods to send and receive messages over a socket connection. 

The `SocketClient` class has three properties: `Id`, `ClientName`, `_handler`, and `_jsonSerializer`. The `Id` property is a unique identifier for the client, while the `ClientName` property is a string that identifies the client. The `_handler` property is an instance of the `ISocketHandler` interface, which is used to handle socket communication. The `_jsonSerializer` property is an instance of the `IJsonSerializer` interface, which is used to serialize and deserialize JSON data.

The `SocketClient` class has four methods: `ProcessAsync`, `SendAsync`, `ReceiveAsync`, and `Dispose`. The `ProcessAsync` method is used to process incoming data from the socket connection. The `SendAsync` method is used to send messages over the socket connection. The `ReceiveAsync` method is used to receive messages over the socket connection. The `Dispose` method is used to dispose of the `SocketClient` object.

The `SendAsync` method first checks if the message is null. If the message is not null, it serializes the message into JSON format and sends it over the socket connection using the `_handler` object. The `ReceiveAsync` method reads data from the socket connection and processes it using the `ProcessAsync` method. The `Dispose` method disposes of the `_handler` object.

The `SocketClient` class uses an array pool to manage memory allocation. The `MAX_POOLED_SIZE` constant is used to set the maximum size of the array pool. The `ReceiveAsync` method uses the array pool to allocate memory for the buffer used to read data from the socket connection. If the buffer grows too large, the array pool is used to allocate a new buffer. When the `ReceiveAsync` method is finished, the buffer is returned to the array pool.

Overall, the `SocketClient` class provides a simple and efficient way to handle socket communication between clients in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SocketClient` class?
- The `SocketClient` class is a C# implementation of a socket client that implements the `ISocketsClient` interface.

2. What is the purpose of the `MAX_POOLED_SIZE` constant?
- The `MAX_POOLED_SIZE` constant is the maximum size of the buffer that can be used to store incoming data from the socket client.

3. What is the purpose of the `SendAsync` method?
- The `SendAsync` method sends a `SocketsMessage` to the socket client if the message is not null and the client name matches the name of the current `SocketClient` instance.
