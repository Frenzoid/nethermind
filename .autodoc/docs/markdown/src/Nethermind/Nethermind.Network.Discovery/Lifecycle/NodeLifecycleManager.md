The `NodeLifecycleManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a node in the discovery network. It is part of the `nethermind` project and is used to manage the discovery of new nodes and maintain the connection with existing nodes. 

The class implements the `INodeLifecycleManager` interface and has several private fields, including `_discoveryManager`, `_nodeTable`, `_logger`, `_discoveryConfig`, `_timestamper`, `_evictionManager`, and `_nodeRecord`. These fields are used to manage the discovery process, maintain the node table, log events, and manage the eviction process.

The class has several public properties, including `ManagedNode`, `State`, and `NodeStats`. `ManagedNode` is the node being managed by the `NodeLifecycleManager`. `State` is the current state of the node, and `NodeStats` is used to track statistics related to the node.

The class has several public methods, including `ProcessPingMsg`, `ProcessEnrResponseMsg`, `ProcessEnrRequestMsg`, `ProcessPongMsg`, `ProcessNeighborsMsg`, `ProcessFindNodeMsg`, `SendFindNode`, `SendPingAsync`, `SendPong`, `SendNeighbors`, `StartEvictionProcess`, and `LostEvictionProcess`. These methods are used to process incoming messages, send messages, and manage the state of the node.

The `ProcessPingMsg` method is called when a `PingMsg` is received from a node. It sends a `PongMsg` in response and updates the node's contact time.

The `ProcessEnrResponseMsg` method is called when an `EnrResponseMsg` is received from a node. It updates the node's ENR sequence and sets the node's state to `ActiveWithEnr`.

The `ProcessEnrRequestMsg` method is called when an `EnrRequestMsg` is received from a node. If the node is bonded, it sends an `EnrResponseMsg` in response.

The `ProcessPongMsg` method is called when a `PongMsg` is received from a node. It checks if the `PongMsg` matches the last `PingMsg` sent and updates the node's state to `Active` if the node is bonded.

The `ProcessNeighborsMsg` method is called when a `NeighborsMsg` is received from a node. It updates the node's contact time and adds any new nodes to the node table.

The `ProcessFindNodeMsg` method is called when a `FindNodeMsg` is received from a node. It sends a `NeighborsMsg` in response with the closest nodes to the searched node ID.

The `SendFindNode` method sends a `FindNodeMsg` to the node.

The `SendPingAsync` method sends a `PingMsg` to the node and waits for a `PongMsg` response.

The `SendPong` method sends a `PongMsg` in response to a `PingMsg`.

The `SendNeighbors` method sends a `NeighborsMsg` to the node.

The `StartEvictionProcess` method sets the node's state to `EvictCandidate`.

The `LostEvictionProcess` method updates the node's state to `ActiveExcluded` if the node is in the `Active` state.

Overall, the `NodeLifecycleManager` class is an important part of the `nethermind` project and is used to manage the discovery of new nodes and maintain the connection with existing nodes. It provides methods for processing incoming messages, sending messages, and managing the state of the node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeLifecycleManager` class?
- The `NodeLifecycleManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a node in the discovery network, including sending and receiving messages, updating node state, and handling eviction.

2. What is the significance of the `IsBonded` property?
- The `IsBonded` property indicates whether the node has successfully completed the bonding process with another node in the network, which requires exchanging ping and pong messages.

3. What is the purpose of the `RefreshNodeContactTime` method?
- The `RefreshNodeContactTime` method updates the last contact time for the node in the routing table, which is used to determine which nodes to evict when the table is full.
