The code defines a class called `EvictionPair` within the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Lifecycle` namespace. The purpose of this class is to represent a pair of `INodeLifecycleManager` objects, where one is an eviction candidate and the other is a replacement candidate. 

The `EvictionPair` class has a constructor that takes two `INodeLifecycleManager` objects as parameters and assigns them to the `EvictionCandidate` and `ReplacementCandidate` properties respectively. These properties are publicly accessible and have a `get` accessor that returns the current value and an `init` accessor that sets the initial value during object initialization. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to manage the lifecycle of nodes in the network discovery process. When a node is deemed to be no longer useful or responsive, it can be marked as an eviction candidate. The `EvictionPair` class can be used to pair this candidate with a replacement candidate, which is another node that can take its place in the network. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in code:

```
INodeLifecycleManager evictionCandidate = GetEvictionCandidate();
INodeLifecycleManager replacementCandidate = GetReplacementCandidate();
EvictionPair pair = new EvictionPair(evictionCandidate, replacementCandidate);
```

In this example, `GetEvictionCandidate()` and `GetReplacementCandidate()` are functions that return `INodeLifecycleManager` objects. The `EvictionPair` constructor is called with these objects as arguments, and a new `EvictionPair` object is created and assigned to the `pair` variable. This `pair` object can then be used to manage the lifecycle of the nodes in the network discovery process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EvictionPair` class?
   - The `EvictionPair` class is used to represent a pair of `INodeLifecycleManager` instances, where one is an eviction candidate and the other is a replacement candidate.

2. What is the significance of the `init` keyword in the property declarations?
   - The `init` keyword is used to indicate that the properties can only be set during object initialization and cannot be modified afterwards.

3. What is the `INodeLifecycleManager` interface and where is it defined?
   - The `INodeLifecycleManager` interface is not defined in this code file and its definition is not provided. A smart developer might need to look for its definition in other parts of the `nethermind` project.
