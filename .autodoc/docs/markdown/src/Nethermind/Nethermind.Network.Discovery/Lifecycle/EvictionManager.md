The `EvictionManager` class is responsible for managing the eviction process of nodes in the network. It is part of the `nethermind` project and is located in the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Lifecycle` namespace. 

The class contains a constructor that takes an `INodeTable` and an `ILogManager` as parameters. The `INodeTable` is an interface that represents a table of nodes in the network, while the `ILogManager` is an interface that provides logging functionality. The constructor initializes private fields for these parameters and throws an exception if the `ILogManager` parameter is null.

The class implements the `IEvictionManager` interface, which defines a method called `StartEvictionProcess`. This method takes two parameters of type `INodeLifecycleManager` and is responsible for starting the eviction process for a node. The `INodeLifecycleManager` interface represents the lifecycle of a node in the network. The method creates a new `EvictionPair` object with the two parameters and adds it to a `ConcurrentDictionary` called `_evictionPairs`. The `Keccak` type is used as the key for the dictionary, which is a hash function used to generate a unique identifier for each node. If an eviction process is already in progress for the node, the method returns without doing anything.

The class also defines a private method called `OnStateChange`, which is an event handler that is called when the state of a node changes. The method checks if the sender is an `INodeLifecycleManager` and if an `EvictionPair` exists for the node. If the node has survived the eviction process, the method logs a message and closes the eviction process. If the node has been evicted, the method replaces the node in the node table and logs a message before closing the eviction process.

Overall, the `EvictionManager` class is an important component of the `nethermind` project that manages the eviction process of nodes in the network. It provides a way to remove nodes that are no longer responsive and replace them with new nodes. The class can be used by other components of the project that need to manage the lifecycle of nodes in the network. For example, it could be used by a peer-to-peer networking component to manage the nodes that are connected to the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EvictionManager` class?
- The `EvictionManager` class is responsible for managing the eviction process of nodes in the routing table.

2. What is the significance of the `EvictionPair` class?
- The `EvictionPair` class represents a pair of nodes, where one node is being evicted and the other is a replacement candidate.

3. What is the purpose of the `OnStateChange` method?
- The `OnStateChange` method is called when the state of a node changes, and it is responsible for handling the node's eviction process based on its new state.
