The `FindNodeMsg` class is a message used in the Nethermind project's network discovery protocol. This message is used to search for nodes on the network that have a specific node ID. 

The class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class, which provides basic functionality for network discovery messages. The `FindNodeMsg` class adds a `SearchedNodeId` property, which is a byte array representing the ID of the node being searched for. 

The `ToString()` method is overridden to include the `SearchedNodeId` property in the string representation of the message. 

The `MsgType` property is also overridden to return `MsgType.FindNode`, indicating that this message is a "find node" message. 

The class has two constructors, one that takes an `IPEndPoint` and a `long` expiration date, and another that takes a `PublicKey` and a `long` expiration date. Both constructors also take a `byte[]` representing the ID of the node being searched for. 

This class is likely used in the larger network discovery protocol of the Nethermind project to allow nodes to search for other nodes on the network based on their node ID. For example, a node may use this message to find other nodes that have a specific ID and then establish connections with those nodes. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the context of the Nethermind project:

```
// create a FindNodeMsg to search for a node with ID "abcdef"
byte[] searchedNodeId = new byte[] { 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef };
FindNodeMsg findNodeMsg = new FindNodeMsg(remoteEndpoint, expirationDate, searchedNodeId);

// send the message over the network
network.Send(findNodeMsg);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class called `FindNodeMsg` that inherits from `DiscoveryMsg` and represents a message used in network discovery. It contains a `SearchedNodeId` property and two constructors that take different parameters to create instances of the class.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?
   - This comment specifies the license under which the code is released and provides a unique identifier for the license that can be used to search for it in SPDX license lists.

3. What other classes or namespaces are used in this code and what is their purpose?
   - This code uses classes from the `System.Net` and `Nethermind.Core.Crypto` namespaces, which provide functionality for working with network addresses and cryptographic operations, respectively. It also uses an extension method from the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace to convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string.
