The code defines a class called `EnrRequestMsg` which is a message used in the Nethermind project's network discovery protocol. The purpose of this message is to request an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) from another node on the network. An ENR is a signed key-value store that contains information about a node, such as its IP address, port, and supported protocols. The ENR is used to facilitate peer discovery and communication in the Ethereum network.

The `EnrRequestMsg` class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class, which is a base class for all messages used in the network discovery protocol. The `EnrRequestMsg` class overrides the `MsgType` property to indicate that it is an ENR request message.

The `EnrRequestMsg` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes an `IPEndPoint` object representing the address of the node to which the message is being sent, and a `long` value representing the expiration date of the message. The second constructor takes a `PublicKey` object representing the public key of the node to which the message is being sent, and a `long` value representing the expiration date of the message.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate peer discovery and communication in the Ethereum network. When a node wants to discover other nodes on the network, it sends an ENR request message to a known node. The known node responds with its ENR, which the requesting node can use to establish a connection and exchange messages with the known node. This process is repeated until the requesting node has discovered a sufficient number of peers to join the network.

Example usage:

```
// create an ENR request message
EnrRequestMsg msg = new EnrRequestMsg(remoteEndpoint, expirationDate);

// send the message to a known node
network.Send(msg);

// receive the response from the known node
EnrResponseMsg response = network.Receive<EnrResponseMsg>();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EnrRequestMsg` class?
   - The `EnrRequestMsg` class is a subclass of `DiscoveryMsg` and represents a message used in the Ethereum network discovery protocol to request an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) from another node.

2. What is the significance of the `MsgType` property?
   - The `MsgType` property is an override of the `MsgType` property in the base `DiscoveryMsg` class and returns the specific message type of `EnrRequest`.

3. What is the `eip-868` referenced in the code comments?
   - The `eip-868` is a reference to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 868, which defines the Ethereum Node Record (ENR) specification used in the Ethereum network discovery protocol.
