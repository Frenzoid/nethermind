[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Network.Discovery/Messages/MsgType.cs)

This code defines an enum called `MsgType` within the `Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Messages` namespace. The `MsgType` enum contains six values, each representing a different type of message that can be sent or received in the context of network discovery. 

The six message types are:
- Ping (1)
- Pong (2)
- FindNode (3)
- Neighbors (4)
- EnrRequest (5)
- EnrResponse (6)

This enum is likely used throughout the larger project to identify and handle different types of network discovery messages. For example, when a message is received, the code may check its `MsgType` to determine how to handle it. 

Here is an example of how this enum might be used in a larger context:

```
using Nethermind.Network.Discovery.Messages;

public void HandleMessage(NetworkMessage message)
{
    switch (message.MsgType)
    {
        case MsgType.Ping:
            // Handle Ping message
            break;
        case MsgType.Pong:
            // Handle Pong message
            break;
        case MsgType.FindNode:
            // Handle FindNode message
            break;
        case MsgType.Neighbors:
            // Handle Neighbors message
            break;
        case MsgType.EnrRequest:
            // Handle EnrRequest message
            break;
        case MsgType.EnrResponse:
            // Handle EnrResponse message
            break;
        default:
            // Unknown message type
            break;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `HandleMessage` method takes a `NetworkMessage` object as input and uses the `MsgType` enum to determine how to handle the message. Depending on the message type, the code may perform different actions or call different methods. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in the network discovery functionality of the larger project by providing a standardized way to identify and handle different types of messages.
