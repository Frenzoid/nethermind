The code defines a class called `PongMsg` which is a message used in the network discovery protocol of the Nethermind project. The purpose of this message is to respond to a `PingMsg` message that was sent by another node on the network. 

The `PongMsg` class inherits from the `DiscoveryMsg` class and adds a `PingMdc` property which is a byte array representing the message digest of the `PingMsg` that was received. The `PingMdc` property is set in the constructor of the class and cannot be null. 

The `PongMsg` class also overrides the `ToString()` method to include the `PingMdc` property in the string representation of the object. 

Finally, the `PongMsg` class defines a `MsgType` property which returns `MsgType.Pong` to indicate that this is a `PongMsg` message.

This code is used in the larger Nethermind project to facilitate network discovery between nodes. When a node wants to discover other nodes on the network, it sends a `PingMsg` message to a known node. The receiving node responds with a `PongMsg` message that includes the `PingMdc` property. The `PingMdc` property allows the sending node to verify that the response is indeed a response to its original `PingMsg` message and not a fake response from a malicious node.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the Nethermind project:

```csharp
// create a new PongMsg message
var pingMdc = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
var pongMsg = new PongMsg(remoteEndpoint, expirationTime, pingMdc);

// send the PongMsg message to the remote node
network.Send(pongMsg);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class called `PongMsg` which is a type of `DiscoveryMsg` used for network discovery. It contains a `PingMdc` property and two constructors that initialize it along with other properties.
   
2. What is the significance of the `PingMdc` property and how is it used?
   - The `PingMdc` property is a byte array that represents the message digest of a `PingMsg` object. It is used to verify the authenticity of the `PingMsg` and ensure that it was not tampered with during transmission.

3. What is the relationship between this code and the `Nethermind` project?
   - This code is part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Network.Discovery.Messages` namespace. It is used to implement network discovery functionality in the project.
