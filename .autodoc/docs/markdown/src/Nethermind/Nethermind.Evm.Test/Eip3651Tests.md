The `Eip3651Tests` class is a test suite for the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) implementation in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this test suite is to verify the behavior of the EVM with respect to EIP-3651, which is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal that introduces a new opcode `EXTBALANCE2` to the EVM. This opcode is intended to replace the existing `BALANCE` opcode, which retrieves the balance of an account given its address.

The test suite contains two test cases: `Access_beneficiary_address_after_eip_3651` and `Access_beneficiary_address_before_eip_3651`. These test cases verify the behavior of the EVM when accessing the balance of an account using the `BALANCE` opcode before and after the activation of EIP-3651, respectively.

In the first test case, the EVM is executed with a bytecode that pushes the address of a miner account onto the stack, retrieves its balance using the `BALANCE` opcode, and then discards the result using the `POP` opcode. The test case expects the execution to succeed with a status code of 1, which indicates that the transaction was successful. Additionally, the test case verifies that the gas cost of the transaction is equal to the sum of the gas cost of the transaction itself and the gas cost of executing the bytecode, which is 105.

In the second test case, the EVM is executed with the same bytecode as in the first test case, but with a block number and timestamp that are before the activation of EIP-3651. The test case expects the execution to succeed with a status code of 1, but with a higher gas cost of 2605. This is because the `BALANCE` opcode is less efficient before the activation of EIP-3651, and requires more gas to execute.

The `Eip3651Tests` class inherits from `VirtualMachineTestsBase`, which is a base class for EVM test suites in the Nethermind project. The `VirtualMachineTestsBase` class provides common functionality for setting up and executing EVM test cases. The `Eip3651Tests` class overrides the `BlockNumber` and `Timestamp` properties to specify the block number and timestamp to use for the test cases.

The `Eip3651Tests` class also overrides the `CreateTracer` method to disable tracing of EVM access. This is done to improve the performance of the test suite, as tracing can be a computationally expensive operation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what does it test?
    
    This file contains tests for EIP-3651 and it tests the access of beneficiary address before and after the implementation of EIP-3651.

2. What dependencies does this file have?
    
    This file has dependencies on FluentAssertions, Nethermind.Core.Extensions, Nethermind.Core.Specs, Nethermind.Specs, Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders, and NUnit.Framework.

3. What is the significance of the overridden `BlockNumber` and `Timestamp` properties?
    
    The overridden `BlockNumber` and `Timestamp` properties set the block number and timestamp to specific values from the MainnetSpecProvider, which is used in the tests to simulate the behavior of the Ethereum mainnet.
