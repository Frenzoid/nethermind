The `Eip1014Tests` class is a test suite for the EIP-1014 implementation in the Nethermind project. EIP-1014 is a proposal for a new opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that enables the creation of contracts at a specific address using a salt value. The tests in this class cover various scenarios for creating contracts using the CREATE2 opcode, including cases where the contract already exists, where the contract has storage, and where the contract does not exist.

The `AssertEip1014` method is used to verify that the contract was created at the expected address with the expected code. The `TestHive` method tests the CREATE2 opcode with a specific code, while the `Test` method tests the CREATE2 opcode with a salt value and an initialization code. The `Test_out_of_gas_existing_account`, `Test_out_of_gas_existing_account_with_storage`, and `Test_out_of_gas_non_existing_account` methods test the CREATE2 opcode in scenarios where the contract creation runs out of gas.

The `Examples_from_eip_spec_are_executed_correctly` method tests the CREATE2 opcode with various examples from the EIP-1014 specification. The test suite uses the `VirtualMachineTestsBase` class as a base class, which provides a virtual machine environment for executing the EVM code.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the EIP-1014 implementation in the Nethermind project works as expected and covers various scenarios for creating contracts using the CREATE2 opcode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AssertEip1014` method?
   - The `AssertEip1014` method is used to assert that the code hash of a given address matches a given hash value computed using the Keccak algorithm.

2. What is the significance of the `Create2` opcode used in the `Test` and `Examples_from_eip_spec_are_executed_correctly` methods?
   - The `Create2` opcode is used to create a new contract with a deterministic address based on the provided salt value, which allows for efficient contract deployment and address prediction.

3. What is the purpose of the `TestState` object and how is it used in the various test methods?
   - The `TestState` object is used to simulate the state of the Ethereum blockchain during testing, allowing for the creation and manipulation of accounts, storage, and code. It is used to set up the initial state for each test and to verify the expected state changes after executing the test code.
