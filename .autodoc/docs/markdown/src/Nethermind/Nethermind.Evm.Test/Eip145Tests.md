The code provided is a set of tests for the EIP-145 implementation in the Nethermind project. EIP-145 is a proposal for a new opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that adds bitwise shifting operations to the EVM. The tests are written using the NUnit testing framework and are located in the `Nethermind.Evm.Test` namespace.

The `Eip145Tests` class inherits from `VirtualMachineTestsBase`, which provides a base implementation for executing EVM bytecode and tracing the execution. The `Eip145Tests` class overrides two methods from the base class: `BlockNumber` and `SpecProvider`. These methods specify the block number and specification provider to use when executing the tests. The tests are written using the `TestCase` attribute, which allows multiple test cases to be defined for a single test method.

The tests themselves are written to test the three bitwise shifting operations provided by EIP-145: `SHL` (shift left), `SHR` (shift right), and `SAR` (arithmetic shift right). Each test case defines three inputs: the value to shift, the number of bits to shift by, and the expected result. The test cases then use the `Prepare.EvmCode` helper class to generate EVM bytecode that performs the specified shift operation and stores the result in storage. The `Execute` method is then called to execute the bytecode, and the `AssertEip145` method is used to verify that the result is correct.

The `AssertEip145` method is a helper method that verifies the result of a shift operation. It takes a `TestAllTracerWithOutput` object, which contains the output of the EVM execution, and the expected result as a byte array or hexadecimal string. The method first verifies that the result was stored in storage at index 0, and then verifies that the gas used by the execution matches the expected gas cost for the result.

Overall, this code provides a set of tests for the EIP-145 implementation in the Nethermind project. The tests verify that the bitwise shifting operations provided by EIP-145 are implemented correctly and that the gas costs for these operations are correct. These tests are an important part of ensuring the correctness and reliability of the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains tests for the EIP-145 implementation in the Nethermind EVM.

2. What is the significance of the `AssertEip145` method?
- The `AssertEip145` method is used to assert the correctness of the EIP-145 implementation by checking the storage value and gas cost of a given transaction.

3. What are the inputs and expected outputs of the `Shift_left`, `Shift_right`, and `Arithmetic_shift_right` test cases?
- The test cases for `Shift_left`, `Shift_right`, and `Arithmetic_shift_right` take in two hexadecimal strings representing integers and expect a third hexadecimal string as the result of a bitwise shift operation.
