The `TxBroadcasterTests` class is a test suite for the `TxBroadcaster` class in the Nethermind project. The `TxBroadcaster` class is responsible for broadcasting transactions to peers in the Ethereum network. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `TxBroadcaster` class is functioning correctly.

The `TxBroadcasterTests` class contains several test cases that test different aspects of the `TxBroadcaster` class. The first test case, `should_not_broadcast_persisted_tx_to_peer_too_quickly`, tests whether the `TxBroadcaster` class waits for a certain amount of time before broadcasting transactions to peers. The test creates a `TxBroadcaster` instance and adds several transactions to it. It then adds a peer to the `TxBroadcaster` instance and checks that the peer has not received any transactions yet. The test then calls the `BroadcastPersistentTxs` method several times and checks that the peer has received the transactions after a certain amount of time has passed.

The second test case, `should_pick_best_persistent_txs_to_broadcast`, tests whether the `TxBroadcaster` class picks the best transactions to broadcast to peers. The test creates a `TxBroadcaster` instance and adds several transactions to it. It then checks that the `GetPersistentTxsToSend` method returns the expected number of transactions.

The third test case, `should_not_pick_txs_with_GasPrice_lower_than_CurrentBaseFee`, tests whether the `TxBroadcaster` class filters out transactions with a gas price lower than the current base fee. The test creates a `TxBroadcaster` instance and adds several transactions to it. It then checks that the `GetPersistentTxsToSend` method returns the expected number of transactions.

The fourth test case, `should_not_pick_1559_txs_with_MaxFeePerGas_lower_than_CurrentBaseFee`, tests whether the `TxBroadcaster` class filters out EIP-1559 transactions with a max fee per gas lower than the current base fee. The test creates a `TxBroadcaster` instance and adds several EIP-1559 transactions to it. It then checks that the `GetPersistentTxsToSend` method returns the expected number of transactions.

The fifth test case, `should_pick_tx_with_lowest_nonce_from_bucket`, tests whether the `TxBroadcaster` class picks the transaction with the lowest nonce from a bucket. The test creates a `TxBroadcaster` instance and adds several transactions to it. It then checks that the `GetPersistentTxsToSend` method returns the expected transaction.

Overall, the `TxBroadcasterTests` class tests the `TxBroadcaster` class thoroughly and ensures that it is functioning correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxBroadcaster` class?
- The `TxBroadcaster` class is responsible for broadcasting transactions to peers in the Ethereum network.

2. What is the significance of the `PeerNotificationThreshold` property in the `TxPoolConfig` class?
- The `PeerNotificationThreshold` property determines the percentage of peers that should be notified when a new transaction is added to the transaction pool.

3. What is the purpose of the `should_pick_tx_with_lowest_nonce_from_bucket` test case?
- The `should_pick_tx_with_lowest_nonce_from_bucket` test case verifies that the `TxBroadcaster` class picks the transaction with the lowest nonce from the transaction pool when broadcasting transactions to peers.
