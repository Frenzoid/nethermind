The `TransactionExtensionsTests` class is a unit test class that tests the `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method of the `Transaction` class. The `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method calculates the maximum gas price that a transaction can afford to pay based on the account balance, gas limit, and the maximum fee per gas. The method takes in four parameters: `isEip1559Enabled`, `baseFee`, `accountBalance`, and `feeCap`. 

The `TransactionExtensionsTests` class contains a single test method `CalculatePayableGasPrice_returns_expected_results` that tests the `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method. The test method uses the `FluentAssertions` library to assert that the calculated payable gas price is equal to the expected payable gas price. The test method uses the `TransactionPayableGasPrice` class to define test cases. The `TransactionPayableGasPrice` class defines the input parameters and the expected output for each test case. The `TransactionPayableGasPriceCases` property is an `IEnumerable` that contains all the test cases. 

The `TransactionPayableGasPriceCases` property contains test cases for different types of transactions, including legacy transactions before and after the EIP-1559 fork, and EIP-1559 transactions before and after the fork. Each test case defines the input parameters and the expected output. 

The purpose of this unit test class is to ensure that the `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method works as expected for different types of transactions. The `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method is an important method in the `Transaction` class, which is used in the larger project to calculate the maximum gas price that a transaction can afford to pay. This information is used to determine whether a transaction should be included in the transaction pool or not. 

Example usage of the `CalculateAffordableGasPrice` method:

```
Transaction tx = new Transaction();
tx.GasPrice = 10;
tx.GasLimit = 300;
tx.Value = 5;
tx.DecodedMaxFeePerGas = 500;

UInt256 payableGasPrice = tx.CalculateAffordableGasPrice(true, 20, 10000);
// payableGasPrice = 30
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionExtensionsTests` class?
- The `TransactionExtensionsTests` class is a test fixture that contains unit tests for the `CalculatePayableGasPrice` method of the `Transaction` class.

2. What is the significance of the `TransactionPayableGasPrice` class?
- The `TransactionPayableGasPrice` class is a helper class that defines test cases for the `CalculatePayableGasPrice` method. Each instance of this class represents a specific test case with input parameters and an expected output.

3. What is the purpose of the `TransactionExtensionsTests.TransactionPayableGasPriceCases` property?
- The `TransactionExtensionsTests.TransactionPayableGasPriceCases` property is a collection of test cases that are used to test the `CalculatePayableGasPrice` method. It returns an `IEnumerable` of `TransactionPayableGasPrice` instances, each representing a specific test case.
