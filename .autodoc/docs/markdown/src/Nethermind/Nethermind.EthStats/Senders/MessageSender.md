The `MessageSender` class is responsible for sending messages to an Ethereum statistics (EthStats) server via a WebSocket connection. It is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to report various statistics about the Ethereum node to the EthStats server.

The `MessageSender` class implements the `IMessageSender` interface, which defines a single method `SendAsync`. This method takes a generic `T` parameter, which must implement the `IMessage` interface. The `IMessage` interface defines a single property `Id` of type `string`. The `SendAsync` method serializes the `message` parameter to JSON using the `JsonConvert.SerializeObject` method and sends it to the EthStats server via the `client` parameter.

The `CreateMessage` method is a private helper method that creates an `EmitMessage` object from the `message` parameter and a `string` `type` parameter. The `EmitMessage` class is a private nested class that represents a message to be sent to the EthStats server. It has a single property `Emit` of type `List<object>`, which contains two elements: the `type` parameter and the `message` parameter.

The `SerializerSettings` field is a `JsonSerializerSettings` object that configures the JSON serializer to use camel case property names.

The `MessageSender` constructor takes a `string` `instanceId` parameter and an `ILogManager` `logManager` parameter. The `instanceId` parameter is used to identify the Ethereum node instance that is sending the message. The `logManager` parameter is used to get an instance of a logger for the `MessageSender` class.

Overall, the `MessageSender` class is a simple implementation of a WebSocket client that sends JSON messages to an EthStats server. It is used to report various statistics about the Ethereum node to the EthStats server. Here is an example of how the `MessageSender` class might be used:

```csharp
var client = new WebsocketClient(new Uri("wss://ethstats.net/ws"));
var sender = new MessageSender("my-node-instance", LogManager.Default);
await client.Start();
await sender.SendAsync(client, new MyMessage { Prop1 = "value1", Prop2 = "value2" });
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code is a C# implementation of a message sender for Ethereum statistics (ETH stats) using WebSockets. It allows sending messages of type `T` that implement the `IMessage` interface to a WebSocket client.
   
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `Nethermind.Logging` and `Websocket.Client` namespaces, as well as the `Newtonsoft.Json` package for JSON serialization.

3. What is the significance of the `ContractResolver` property in the `SerializerSettings` object?
   - The `ContractResolver` property specifies the contract resolver used during serialization to determine how object members are serialized and deserialized. In this case, it is set to a `CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver`, which serializes object members using camel case naming conventions.
