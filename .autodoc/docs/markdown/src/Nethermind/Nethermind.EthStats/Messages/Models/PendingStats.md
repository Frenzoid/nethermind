[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.EthStats/Messages/Models/PendingStats.cs)

The code above defines a C# class called `PendingStats` that is used to represent pending statistics for Ethereum transactions. The class has a single property called `Pending` which is an integer representing the number of pending transactions. The constructor for the class takes an integer argument which is used to initialize the `Pending` property.

This class is part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `EthStats.Messages.Models` namespace. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and modules in the project to provide real-time statistics on the Ethereum network.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.EthStats.Messages.Models;

// ...

// Get the number of pending transactions from some external source
int pendingTxCount = GetPendingTransactionCount();

// Create a new PendingStats object with the pending transaction count
PendingStats pendingStats = new PendingStats(pendingTxCount);

// Send the pending stats to some other module or service
SendPendingStats(pendingStats);
```

In this example, the `PendingStats` class is used to create an object representing the current number of pending transactions on the Ethereum network. This object is then passed to another module or service for further processing or analysis.

Overall, the `PendingStats` class provides a simple and flexible way to represent pending transaction statistics in the `Nethermind` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `PendingStats` in the `Nethermind.EthStats.Messages.Models` namespace, which has a single property `Pending` of type `int`.

2. Why is the `Pending` property read-only?
   The `Pending` property is read-only because it is set only once in the constructor of the `PendingStats` class and cannot be modified afterwards.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
