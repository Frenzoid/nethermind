The `StatementHistoryManager` class is responsible for managing the command history of the Nethermind CLI console. It is used to keep track of the commands that have been executed in the console and to persist them to a file for future use.

The class has two main methods: `UpdateHistory` and `Init`. The `UpdateHistory` method is called every time a new command is executed in the console. It takes the command as a parameter and adds it to the command history. If the command contains any of the secured commands (currently "unlockAccount" and "newAccount"), it is not added to the history and instead a placeholder string ("*removed*") is added. The command history is then persisted to a file.

The `Init` method is called when the console is started. It loads the command history from the history file and adds it to the console's history. If the history file does not exist, it is created.

The `StatementHistoryManager` class uses the `IFileSystem` and `ICliConsole` interfaces to interact with the file system and console, respectively. This allows for easier testing and mocking of these dependencies.

Overall, the `StatementHistoryManager` class is a small but important part of the Nethermind CLI console. It ensures that the user's command history is persisted and loaded correctly, and provides a way to secure certain commands from being recorded in the history.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StatementHistoryManager` class?
    
    The `StatementHistoryManager` class is responsible for managing the command history of the CLI console.

2. What is the significance of the `SecuredCommands` property?
    
    The `SecuredCommands` property is a list of commands that are considered to be secured and will not be saved in the command history.

3. What happens if there is an error while writing or loading the command history?
    
    If there is an error while writing or loading the command history, an error message will be printed to the console. If the error occurs while writing, the error message will only be printed once.
