The code above defines a custom attribute class called `CliFunctionAttribute` that can be used to annotate methods in the Nethermind project's command-line interface (CLI) modules. The purpose of this attribute is to provide metadata about CLI functions that can be used to generate documentation and help messages for users.

The `CliFunctionAttribute` class has several properties that can be set when the attribute is applied to a method. These properties include `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`. The `ObjectName` and `FunctionName` properties are required and specify the name of the object and function that the CLI function corresponds to. The `Description` property provides a brief description of what the function does, while the `ResponseDescription` property describes the format of the response that the function returns. The `ExampleResponse` property can be used to provide an example of what the response might look like.

Here is an example of how the `CliFunctionAttribute` might be used to annotate a method in a CLI module:

```
[CliFunction("accounts", "list")]
[Description("List all accounts")]
[ResponseDescription("An array of account addresses")]
[ExampleResponse("[\"0x1234567890abcdef\", \"0xabcdef1234567890\"]")]
public void ListAccounts()
{
    // implementation
}
```

In this example, the `ListAccounts` method is annotated with the `CliFunctionAttribute` and several properties are set to provide metadata about the function. When the CLI module is loaded, the metadata provided by the `CliFunctionAttribute` can be used to generate help messages and documentation for users.

Overall, the `CliFunctionAttribute` class is a useful tool for providing metadata about CLI functions in the Nethermind project. By using this attribute to annotate methods in CLI modules, developers can ensure that users have access to helpful documentation and help messages when using the CLI.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom attribute called `CliFunctionAttribute` that can be used to annotate methods in a CLI module.

2. What properties does the `CliFunctionAttribute` class have?
   The `CliFunctionAttribute` class has properties for `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToString` method in the `CliFunctionAttribute` class?
   The `ToString` method returns a string representation of the `CliFunctionAttribute` instance, including the `ObjectName`, `FunctionName`, and `Description` properties (if present). This is likely used for displaying help text or usage information in the CLI.
