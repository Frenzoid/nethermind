The code defines a custom attribute class called `CliPropertyAttribute` that can be used to annotate properties in a command-line interface (CLI) module of the Nethermind project. The purpose of this attribute is to provide metadata about the properties that can be used to generate help documentation for the CLI commands.

The `CliPropertyAttribute` class has several properties that can be set when the attribute is applied to a property in a CLI module. These properties include `ObjectName`, `PropertyName`, `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`. 

- `ObjectName` and `PropertyName` are required parameters for the attribute constructor and specify the name of the object and property that the attribute is applied to. 
- `Description` is an optional property that provides a description of the property that can be used in the help documentation. 
- `ResponseDescription` is another optional property that provides a description of the expected response when the property is used in a CLI command. 
- `ExampleResponse` is an optional property that provides an example response for the property.

The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the attribute that includes the `ObjectName`, `PropertyName`, and `Description` properties.

Here is an example of how the `CliPropertyAttribute` can be used to annotate a property in a CLI module:

```
public class MyCliModule : ICliModule
{
    [CliProperty("myobject", "myproperty", Description = "This is my property")]
    public string MyProperty { get; set; }

    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `MyProperty` property is annotated with the `CliPropertyAttribute` and the `ObjectName` is set to "myobject" and the `PropertyName` is set to "myproperty". The `Description` property is also set to "This is my property". This metadata can be used to generate help documentation for the `MyCliModule` module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom attribute called `CliPropertyAttribute` that can be used to annotate properties in a CLI module.

2. What properties can be set using this attribute?
   The `CliPropertyAttribute` has several properties that can be set, including `Description`, `ResponseDescription`, and `ExampleResponse`.

3. How is the `ToString()` method used?
   The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the attribute that includes the `ObjectName`, `PropertyName`, and `Description` (if present). This string can be used for display or logging purposes.
