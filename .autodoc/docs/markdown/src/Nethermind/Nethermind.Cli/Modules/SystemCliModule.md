The `SystemCliModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project's command-line interface (CLI) that provides functionality related to system information. The purpose of this module is to allow users to retrieve system information and statistics through the CLI. 

The `SystemCliModule` class contains two methods: `GetVariable` and `Memory`. The `GetVariable` method retrieves the value of an environment variable specified by the user. The method takes two parameters: `name` and `defaultValue`. The `name` parameter is the name of the environment variable to retrieve, and the `defaultValue` parameter is the value to return if the environment variable is not found. If the environment variable is found, the method returns its value. If the environment variable is not found or its value is empty or whitespace, the method returns the `defaultValue`.

Here is an example of how to use the `GetVariable` method in the CLI:

```
> system getVariable MY_VAR "default value"
default value
```

In this example, the `GetVariable` method is called with the `name` parameter set to `MY_VAR` and the `defaultValue` parameter set to `"default value"`. Since `MY_VAR` is not an environment variable, the method returns the `defaultValue`.

The `Memory` method returns a string containing information about the memory usage and garbage collection of the system. The method takes two parameters: `name` and `defaultValue`, but they are not used in the method. The method uses the `GC` class to retrieve information about the memory usage and garbage collection. The returned string contains the total amount of memory allocated by the system, as well as the number of times garbage collection has occurred for each generation (0, 1, and 2).

Here is an example of how to use the `Memory` method in the CLI:

```
> system memory
Allocated: 123456, GC0: 1, GC1: 2, GC2: 3
```

In this example, the `Memory` method is called without any parameters. The method returns a string containing information about the memory usage and garbage collection of the system.

Overall, the `SystemCliModule` class provides users with a way to retrieve system information and statistics through the Nethermind CLI. The `GetVariable` method allows users to retrieve the value of an environment variable, while the `Memory` method provides information about the memory usage and garbage collection of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a CLI module for the nethermind project that provides functions and properties related to system information.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier and SPDX-FileCopyrightText comments?
   - These comments indicate the license under which the code is released and provide attribution to the copyright holder.

3. What is the purpose of the ICliEngine and INodeManager parameters in the constructor of the SystemCliModule class?
   - These parameters are dependencies that are required by the base class (CliModuleBase) and are passed to its constructor. The ICliEngine is used to interact with the CLI engine and the INodeManager is used to manage the node instance.
