The `NetCliModule` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for providing command-line interface (CLI) commands related to network information. This class is decorated with the `[CliModule("net")]` attribute, which indicates that it is a CLI module for the `net` command.

The class contains three methods, each of which corresponds to a different `net` command. The first method, `LocalEnode()`, returns the local enode of the node. The enode is a unique identifier for a node on the Ethereum network. This method sends a POST request to the `net_localEnode` endpoint of the `NodeManager` instance and returns the result as a string.

The second method, `Version()`, returns the version of the Ethereum network that the node is connected to. This method sends a POST request to the `net_version` endpoint of the `NodeManager` instance and returns the result as a `JsValue`. The `JsValue` type is a Jint-specific type that represents a JavaScript value.

The third method, `PeerCount()`, returns the number of peers that the node is connected to. This method sends a POST request to the `net_peerCount` endpoint of the `NodeManager` instance and returns the result as a `long`.

All three methods are decorated with the `[CliProperty]` attribute, which indicates that they are CLI properties of the `net` command. The first argument of the attribute specifies the name of the command (`net`), and the second argument specifies the name of the property (`localEnode`, `version`, or `peerCount`).

This class is instantiated with an `ICliEngine` instance and an `INodeManager` instance in the constructor. The `ICliEngine` instance is used to register the CLI properties, and the `INodeManager` instance is used to send POST requests to the Ethereum node.

Overall, the `NetCliModule` class provides a convenient way for users to access network information from the command line. For example, a user can run the `net localEnode` command to get the local enode of the node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file is a module for the Nethermind CLI tool that provides functionality related to network information and management.

2. What is the significance of the `CliProperty` attribute used in this code?
   - The `CliProperty` attribute is used to define a command-line interface (CLI) property that can be accessed by users of the Nethermind CLI tool. In this code, it is used to define properties related to network information such as `localEnode`, `version`, and `peerCount`.

3. What is the role of the `NodeManager` parameter in the constructor of the `NetCliModule` class?
   - The `NodeManager` parameter is used to inject an instance of the `INodeManager` interface into the `NetCliModule` class, which provides access to the underlying node implementation. This allows the module to interact with the node to retrieve network information and perform other network-related tasks.
