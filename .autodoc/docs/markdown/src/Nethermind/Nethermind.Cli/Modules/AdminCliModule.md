The code defines a class called `AdminCliModule` that is a part of the `Nethermind.Cli.Modules` namespace. This class is used to implement a command-line interface (CLI) module for the Nethermind project. The purpose of this module is to provide administrative functionality to the user through the CLI.

The `AdminCliModule` class has four methods, each of which is decorated with a `CliFunction` or `CliProperty` attribute. These attributes are used to define the name and description of the CLI command that corresponds to each method. The `CliFunction` attribute is used for methods that perform an action, while the `CliProperty` attribute is used for methods that return a value.

The `Peers` method returns a list of connected peers. It takes an optional boolean parameter `includeDetails` that, if set to true, includes additional details about each peer. The method calls the `Post` method of the `NodeManager` object with the parameters `"admin_peers"` and `includeDetails` to retrieve the list of peers.

The `NodeInfo` method returns information about the current node. It calls the `Post` method of the `NodeManager` object with the parameter `"admin_nodeInfo"` to retrieve the node information.

The `AddPeer` method adds a new peer to the static nodes. It takes two parameters: `enode`, which is the enode URL of the node to be added, and `addToStaticNodes`, which is a boolean parameter that, if set to true, adds the node to the static nodes. The method calls the `Post` method of the `NodeManager` object with the parameters `"admin_addPeer"`, `enode`, and `addToStaticNodes` to add the new peer.

The `RemovePeer` method removes a peer from the static nodes. It takes two parameters: `enode`, which is the enode URL of the node to be removed, and `removeFromStaticNodes`, which is a boolean parameter that, if set to true, removes the node from the static nodes. The method calls the `Post` method of the `NodeManager` object with the parameters `"admin_removePeer"`, `enode`, and `removeFromStaticNodes` to remove the peer.

Overall, the `AdminCliModule` class provides a set of CLI commands that allow the user to manage the connected peers and the static nodes of the Nethermind node. These commands can be used to add or remove peers, retrieve information about the node, and display a list of connected peers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a CLI module for the Nethermind project that provides functionality related to node administration, such as displaying connected peers and adding/removing nodes from the static nodes list.

2. What is the significance of the `CliModule` and `CliFunction` attributes?
- The `CliModule` attribute is used to mark the class as a CLI module and specify its name, while the `CliFunction` attribute is used to mark methods as CLI functions and specify their names and descriptions. These attributes are used by the CLI engine to identify and execute the appropriate commands.

3. What is the `NodeManager` object and where does it come from?
- The `NodeManager` object is used to interact with the Ethereum node managed by the Nethermind project. It is passed to the `AdminCliModule` constructor as a dependency, and its methods are used to perform various node-related tasks such as retrieving information about connected peers and adding/removing nodes from the static nodes list.
