The `NodeCliModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a node. It contains several methods that allow the user to switch between nodes, set the node key, and retrieve information about the current node.

The `SetNodeKey` method takes a private key as input, converts it to bytes, and writes it to a file called `node.key.plain`. This method is useful for setting the private key of a node, which is required for signing transactions and blocks.

The `Switch` method takes a URI as input and switches the current node to the one specified by the URI. If the URI does not contain a port number, it defaults to port 8545. If the URI does not start with "http://" or "https://", it adds "http://" to the beginning. This method is useful for switching between nodes when running multiple nodes.

The `SwitchLocal` method takes a URI as input and switches the current node to the one specified by the URI, but with "http://localhost" as the host. This method is useful for switching to a node running on the same machine.

The `Address` method returns the address of the current node in string format. The `Enode` method returns the enode of the current node in string format. The `Uri` method returns the URI of the current node in `JsValue` format.

The `GetVariable` method is a private method that takes a variable name and a default value as input and returns the value of the variable if it exists, or the default value if it does not. This method is used by the `SwitchLocal` method to get the value of an environment variable called `NETHERMIND_CLI_SWITCH_LOCAL`.

Overall, the `NodeCliModule` class provides a convenient way for users to interact with a node through the command line. It allows users to switch between nodes, set the node key, and retrieve information about the current node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file is a C# class that defines a CLI module for the nethermind project. It provides functionality for setting node keys, switching between nodes, and retrieving node properties.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code file uses the Jint and Nethermind libraries, as well as the System and System.IO namespaces.

3. What is the role of the `CliModuleBase` class that `NodeCliModule` inherits from?
    
    The `CliModuleBase` class provides a base implementation for CLI modules in the nethermind project, including common functionality like command registration and argument parsing. `NodeCliModule` extends this base class to provide node-related commands.
