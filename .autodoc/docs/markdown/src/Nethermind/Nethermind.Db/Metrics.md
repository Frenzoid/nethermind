The `Metrics` class is a collection of static properties that are used to track various database operations within the Nethermind project. Each property is decorated with custom attributes that define the type of metric being tracked and provide a description of what the metric represents. 

The `CounterMetric` attribute is used to track the number of times a particular operation has been performed, while the `GaugeMetric` attribute is used to track the current state of a particular operation. 

For example, the `BloomDbReads` property tracks the number of times the Bloom filter database has been read, while the `StateDbPruning` property tracks whether the state database is currently being pruned. 

These metrics can be used to monitor the performance of the various database operations within the Nethermind project, and to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization. 

For example, if the `BloomDbReads` metric is consistently high, it may indicate that the Bloom filter database is being accessed too frequently and that optimizations should be made to reduce the number of reads. 

Similarly, if the `StateDbPruning` metric is set to 1, it indicates that the state database is currently being pruned, which may impact the performance of other operations that rely on the state database. 

Overall, the `Metrics` class provides a simple and standardized way to track database performance within the Nethermind project, and can be used to identify and address performance issues as they arise. 

Example usage:

```csharp
Metrics.BloomDbReads++;
Metrics.StateDbPruning = 1;
long storageTreeReads = Metrics.StorageTreeReads;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a static class called `Metrics` that contains various properties with attributes that define metrics for different types of database reads and writes.

2. What is the significance of the `CounterMetric` and `GaugeMetric` attributes used in this code?
   
   The `CounterMetric` attribute is used to indicate that a property represents a counter metric, which is a metric that is incremented or decremented based on certain events. The `GaugeMetric` attribute is used to indicate that a property represents a gauge metric, which is a metric that represents a value that can go up or down over time.

3. What is the purpose of the `ConcurrentDictionary` used in the `DbStats` property?
   
   The `ConcurrentDictionary` is used to store key-value pairs that represent various database statistics. It is used to ensure that the dictionary can be accessed and modified safely from multiple threads at the same time.
