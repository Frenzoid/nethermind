This code defines an interface called `IReadOnlyDb` within the `Nethermind.Db` namespace. The purpose of this interface is to provide read-only access to a database, which is a key component of the larger Nethermind project. 

The `IReadOnlyDb` interface extends the `IDb` interface, which means that any class that implements `IReadOnlyDb` must also implement all the methods defined in `IDb`. This ensures that any class that uses `IReadOnlyDb` can also perform all the necessary database operations.

The only additional method defined in `IReadOnlyDb` is `ClearTempChanges()`. This method is used to clear any temporary changes made to the database. This is useful in situations where a transaction fails and needs to be rolled back, or when a temporary change is made for testing purposes and needs to be undone.

Here is an example of how `IReadOnlyDb` might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Db;

public class MyDatabaseReader
{
    private readonly IReadOnlyDb _database;

    public MyDatabaseReader(IReadOnlyDb database)
    {
        _database = database;
    }

    public void ReadData()
    {
        // Perform read-only operations on the database
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyDatabaseReader` is a class that reads data from a database. It takes an instance of `IReadOnlyDb` as a constructor parameter, which allows it to read data from any class that implements this interface. By using `IReadOnlyDb`, `MyDatabaseReader` can be sure that it will not accidentally modify the database, which is important for maintaining data integrity.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IReadOnlyDb` interface?
   - The `IReadOnlyDb` interface extends the `IDb` interface and adds a method `ClearTempChanges()`, indicating that it is intended for read-only database operations that may have temporary changes.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released, in this case, the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What is the `namespace` used for in this code?
   - The `namespace` statement is used to define a scope that contains a set of related objects, in this case, the `Nethermind.Db` namespace that contains the `IReadOnlyDb` interface.
