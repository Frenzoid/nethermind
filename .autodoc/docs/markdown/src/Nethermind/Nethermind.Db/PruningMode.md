This code defines an enum called `PruningMode` and an extension class called `PruningModeExtensions`. The `PruningMode` enum is used to define different modes of pruning for a database. Pruning is the process of removing old or unnecessary data from a database to reduce its size and improve performance. The `PruningMode` enum has four possible values: `None`, `Memory`, `Full`, and `Hybrid`. 

The `None` value indicates that no pruning is performed and the database is a full archive. The `Memory` value indicates that only in-memory pruning is performed, meaning that old data is removed from memory but kept on disk. The `Full` value indicates that full pruning is performed, meaning that old data is removed from both memory and disk. The `Hybrid` value indicates that both in-memory and full pruning are performed.

The `PruningModeExtensions` class provides two extension methods for the `PruningMode` enum: `IsMemory` and `IsFull`. These methods are used to check whether a given `PruningMode` value includes in-memory pruning or full pruning, respectively. 

This code is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a flexible and configurable way to manage the size and performance of its databases. For example, a user of the Nethermind project may want to configure their database to perform in-memory pruning to reduce memory usage, but still keep old data on disk for historical purposes. They could do this by setting the `PruningMode` value to `Memory`. Alternatively, a user may want to completely remove old data from both memory and disk to improve performance. They could do this by setting the `PruningMode` value to `Full`. The `PruningModeExtensions` class provides a convenient way to check which pruning modes are enabled for a given `PruningMode` value. 

Example usage:

```
// Set pruning mode to in-memory pruning only
PruningMode mode = PruningMode.Memory;

// Check if in-memory pruning is enabled
bool isMemoryEnabled = mode.IsMemory(); // returns true

// Check if full pruning is enabled
bool isFullEnabled = mode.IsFull(); // returns false
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an enum called `PruningMode` and an extension class for it, which provides methods to check if a given `PruningMode` value has the `Memory` or `Full` flag set.

2. What is the significance of the `Flags` attribute on the `PruningMode` enum?
   - The `Flags` attribute indicates that the enum values can be combined using bitwise OR operations. In this case, the `Hybrid` value is defined as a combination of `Memory` and `Full`.

3. What is the difference between `Memory` and `Full` pruning modes?
   - `Memory` pruning mode indicates that only recent data is kept in memory, while older data is stored on disk. `Full` pruning mode indicates that all data is stored on disk, and no data is kept in memory.
