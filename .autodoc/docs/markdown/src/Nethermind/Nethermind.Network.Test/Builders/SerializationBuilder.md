The `SerializationBuilder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for building and configuring the message serialization service used in the network layer of the project. The message serialization service is responsible for serializing and deserializing messages sent between nodes in the network. 

The `SerializationBuilder` class provides a set of methods that allow the user to configure the serialization service for different types of messages. The methods are grouped by the type of message they handle, such as P2P, Eth, Eth65, Eth66, Eth68, and Discovery. 

Each method adds a set of message serializers to the serialization service. For example, the `WithP2P` method adds serializers for the Ping, Pong, Hello, and Disconnect messages. Similarly, the `WithEth` method adds serializers for the BlockHeaders, BlockBodies, GetBlockBodies, GetBlockHeaders, NewBlockHashes, NewBlock, Transactions, and Status messages. 

The `SerializationBuilder` class also provides a method for adding message serializers for the encryption handshake. The `WithEncryptionHandshake` method adds serializers for the Auth, AuthEip8, Ack, and AckEip8 messages. 

The `SerializationBuilder` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to configure the message serialization service used in the network layer. By providing a set of methods for configuring the serialization service, the `SerializationBuilder` class makes it easy for developers to add support for new message types to the network layer. 

Example usage:

```csharp
// create a new SerializationBuilder instance
SerializationBuilder builder = new SerializationBuilder();

// configure the serialization service for P2P messages
builder.WithP2P();

// configure the serialization service for Eth messages
builder.WithEth();

// configure the serialization service for Eth65 messages
builder.WithEth65();

// configure the serialization service for Eth66 messages
builder.WithEth66();

// configure the serialization service for Eth68 messages
builder.WithEth68();

// configure the serialization service for Discovery messages
PrivateKey privateKey = new PrivateKey();
builder.WithDiscovery(privateKey);

// get the configured message serialization service
IMessageSerializationService serializationService = builder.Build();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a builder class for creating message serialization services for various network protocols used in the Nethermind project.

2. What are some of the protocols supported by this builder?
   - This builder supports protocols such as P2P, Eth, Eth65, Eth66, Eth68, and Discovery.

3. What is the role of the `With` methods in this builder?
   - The `With` methods are used to register message serializers for various message types within the specified protocol. For example, the `WithEth` method registers serializers for message types related to the Eth protocol.
