The `NodeStatsTests` class is a test suite for the `NodeStatsLight` class, which is responsible for capturing and calculating various statistics related to a node's performance. The `NodeStatsLight` class is part of the `Nethermind` project, which is a .NET Ethereum client implementation.

The `NodeStatsLight` class is instantiated with a `Node` object, which represents a peer node in the Ethereum network. The `NodeStatsLight` class captures various statistics related to the node's performance, such as transfer speed, latency, and connection delay. These statistics are captured using the `AddTransferSpeedCaptureEvent`, `AddNodeStatsDisconnectEvent`, and `AddNodeStatsEvent` methods.

The `TransferSpeedCaptureTest` method tests the `AddTransferSpeedCaptureEvent` method by adding multiple transfer speed capture events and verifying that the average transfer speed is calculated correctly. The `DisconnectDelayTest` method tests the `AddNodeStatsDisconnectEvent` method by adding a disconnect event and verifying that the connection delay is calculated correctly. The `DisconnectDelayDueToNodeStatsEvent` and `DisconnectDelayDueToDisconnect` methods test the `AddNodeStatsEvent` method by adding various node stats events and disconnect events and verifying that the connection delay is calculated correctly.

Overall, the `NodeStatsLight` class and the `NodeStatsTests` class are important components of the `Nethermind` project, as they provide valuable insights into the performance of Ethereum nodes in the network. These insights can be used to optimize the performance of the Ethereum client and improve the overall user experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeStatsTests` class?
- The `NodeStatsTests` class is a test suite for testing the `NodeStatsLight` class, which captures and calculates various statistics related to network nodes.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `NodeStatsTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `NodeStatsTests` class can be run in parallel, which can improve test execution time.

3. What is the difference between the `TransferSpeedCaptureTest` and `DisconnectDelayTest` methods?
- The `TransferSpeedCaptureTest` method tests the calculation of average transfer speeds for different types of data, while the `DisconnectDelayTest` method tests the delay in detecting a disconnection event and the subsequent reconnection.
