The `NetworkStorageTests` class is a test suite for the `NetworkStorage` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to test the functionality of the `NetworkStorage` class, which is responsible for storing and managing network nodes and peers. 

The `SetUp` method initializes the `NetworkStorage` object with a `SimpleFilePublicKeyDb` object and a `LogManager` object. The `TearDown` method disposes of the temporary directory created during the test. 

The `CreateLifecycleManager` method creates a `NodeLifecycleManager` object for a given `Node` object. The `NodeLifecycleManager` object is used to manage the lifecycle of the node and to provide statistics about the node. 

The `Can_store_discovery_nodes` method tests the ability of the `NetworkStorage` object to store and retrieve discovery nodes. It creates an array of `Node` objects and an array of `NodeLifecycleManager` objects, and then creates an array of `NetworkNode` objects from the `NodeLifecycleManager` objects. The `NetworkStorage` object is then used to store the `NetworkNode` objects, and the stored nodes are retrieved and compared to the original nodes to ensure that they were stored correctly. The method then removes one of the nodes and verifies that it was removed from the storage. 

The `Can_store_peers` method tests the ability of the `NetworkStorage` object to store and retrieve peers. It creates an array of `Node` objects and an array of `NetworkNode` objects from the `Node` objects. The `NetworkStorage` object is then used to store the `NetworkNode` objects, and the stored peers are retrieved and compared to the original peers to ensure that they were stored correctly. The method then removes one of the peers and verifies that it was removed from the storage. 

Overall, the `NetworkStorageTests` class provides a suite of tests to ensure that the `NetworkStorage` class is functioning correctly. These tests are important to ensure that the network nodes and peers are being stored and managed correctly, which is essential for the proper functioning of the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NetworkStorage` class?
- The `NetworkStorage` class is used to store and manage information about network nodes and peers.

2. What is the difference between `Can_store_discovery_nodes` and `Can_store_peers` tests?
- The `Can_store_discovery_nodes` test stores and retrieves information about discovery nodes, while the `Can_store_peers` test stores and retrieves information about peers.

3. What is the purpose of the `CreateLifecycleManager` method?
- The `CreateLifecycleManager` method creates a new instance of `INodeLifecycleManager` and sets its `ManagedNode` and `NodeStats` properties based on the provided `Node` object.
