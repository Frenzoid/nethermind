This code defines a test suite for the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing messages containing transaction hashes. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class is working correctly.

The `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializerTests` class contains three test methods: `Roundtrip`, `Empty_serialization`, and `Non_empty_serialization`. Each of these methods tests a different scenario for serializing and deserializing transaction hashes.

The `Roundtrip` method tests the serialization and deserialization of a message containing three transaction types, three transaction sizes, and three transaction hashes. The `Test` method is called with the transaction types, sizes, and hashes, and the resulting message is serialized and deserialized using the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class. The `SerializerTester.TestZero` method is used to compare the original message with the deserialized message to ensure that they are equal.

The `Empty_serialization` method tests the serialization and deserialization of an empty message. The `Test` method is called with empty arrays for the transaction types, sizes, and hashes, and the expected result is a serialized message with the hex value `c380c0c0`.

The `Non_empty_serialization` method tests the serialization and deserialization of a message containing one transaction type, one transaction size, and one transaction hash. The `Test` method is called with the transaction type, size, and hash, and the expected result is a serialized message with the hex value `e501c102e1a0` followed by the hash value.

Overall, this code is a test suite for the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class in the `Nethermind` project. It tests the serialization and deserialization of messages containing transaction hashes in various scenarios to ensure that the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class is working correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains tests for the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessageSerializer` class in the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Eth.V68.Messages` namespace.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the test fixture?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute with `ParallelScope.All` value indicates that the tests in this fixture can be run in parallel.

3. What is the purpose of the `TestZero` method being called in the `Test` method?
- The `TestZero` method is used to test the serialization and deserialization of the `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage68` object with zero values.
