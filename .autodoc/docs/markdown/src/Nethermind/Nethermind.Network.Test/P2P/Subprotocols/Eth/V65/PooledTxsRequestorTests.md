This code is a test suite for the `PooledTxsRequestor` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is responsible for requesting pooled transactions from the transaction pool. The test suite contains five test cases that test the behavior of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class under different conditions.

The first test case tests if the `PooledTxsRequestor` class filters out new pooled transaction hashes properly. The test creates a new `PooledTxsRequestor` instance and requests transactions with two new pooled transaction hashes. Then, it requests transactions with three pooled transaction hashes, including the two new ones. The test expects the `PooledTxsRequestor` instance to return the one pooled transaction hash that was not requested in the first request.

The second test case tests if the `PooledTxsRequestor` class filters out already pending hashes properly. The test creates a new `PooledTxsRequestor` instance and requests transactions with three pooled transaction hashes. Then, it requests transactions with the same three pooled transaction hashes. The test expects the `PooledTxsRequestor` instance to return an empty list because the hashes were already requested.

The third test case tests if the `PooledTxsRequestor` class filters out discovered hashes properly. The test creates a new `PooledTxsRequestor` instance and requests transactions with three pooled transaction hashes. The test expects the `PooledTxsRequestor` instance to return the same three pooled transaction hashes.

The fourth test case tests if the `PooledTxsRequestor` class can handle empty arguments. The test creates a new `PooledTxsRequestor` instance and requests transactions with an empty list. The test expects the `PooledTxsRequestor` instance to return an empty list.

The fifth test case tests if the `PooledTxsRequestor` class filters out hashes present in the hash cache properly. The test creates a new `PooledTxsRequestor` instance and requests transactions with two pooled transaction hashes, one of which is present in the hash cache. The test expects the `PooledTxsRequestor` instance to return an empty list because one of the hashes is already known.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the `PooledTxsRequestor` class behaves correctly under different conditions and that it filters out hashes properly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PooledTxsRequestor` class?
- The `PooledTxsRequestor` class is responsible for requesting pooled transactions from the transaction pool.

2. What is the purpose of the `filter_properly_newPooledTxHashes` test method?
- The `filter_properly_newPooledTxHashes` test method tests whether the `PooledTxsRequestor` class filters out already pending transactions and returns only new pooled transactions.

3. What is the purpose of the `Send` method?
- The `Send` method is a callback method that is called when the `PooledTxsRequestor` class receives a response from the transaction pool. It sets the `_response` field to the list of transaction hashes received in the response.
