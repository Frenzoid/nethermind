This code is a part of the nethermind project and is located in the `nethermind` directory. The purpose of this code is to test the `GetReceiptsMessage` class of the `Nethermind.Network.P2P.Subprotocols.Eth.V63.Messages` namespace. 

The `GetReceiptsMessage` class is used to represent a message that requests receipts for a given set of transaction hashes. The class takes an array of `Keccak` hashes as a constructor argument and sets the `Hashes` property to this value. The `Keccak` class is a cryptographic hash function used in Ethereum. 

The `GetReceiptsMessageTests` class contains three test methods that test the behavior of the `GetReceiptsMessage` class. The first test method, `Sets_values_from_constructor_argument()`, creates an instance of the `GetReceiptsMessage` class with an array of `Keccak` hashes and asserts that the `Hashes` property is set to the same value. The second test method, `Throws_on_null_argument()`, tests that an exception is thrown when a null argument is passed to the constructor. The third test method, `To_string()`, creates an instance of the `GetReceiptsMessage` class with an empty list of `Keccak` hashes and calls the `ToString()` method to test that it does not throw an exception.

Overall, this code is used to ensure that the `GetReceiptsMessage` class behaves as expected and can be used correctly in the larger nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetReceiptsMessage` class?
- The `GetReceiptsMessage` class is a subprotocol message used in the Ethereum network to request receipts for a given block.

2. What is the significance of the `Parallelizable` attribute on the `GetReceiptsMessageTests` class?
- The `Parallelizable` attribute indicates that the tests in the `GetReceiptsMessageTests` class can be run in parallel, potentially improving test execution time.

3. Why is the `ToString` method called on the `GetReceiptsMessage` instance in the `To_string` test?
- The `ToString` method is called on the `GetReceiptsMessage` instance in the `To_string` test to ensure that the method does not throw any exceptions and to provide coverage for the method in the test suite.
