This code is a test file for the NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this class is to serialize and deserialize messages related to new block hashes in the Ethereum network. 

The Roundtrip() method tests the functionality of the NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer class by creating a new instance of the NewBlockHashesMessage class with two tuples of Keccak hashes and block numbers. The method then creates a new instance of the NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer class and uses the SerializerTester class to test the serialization and deserialization of the message. This ensures that the message can be properly encoded and decoded for transmission over the network.

The To_string() method tests the ToString() method of the NewBlockHashesMessage class. It creates a new instance of the class and calls the ToString() method to ensure that it returns a string representation of the message.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Nethermind project as it ensures that messages related to new block hashes can be properly serialized and deserialized for transmission over the Ethereum network. By testing the functionality of the NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer class, this code helps to ensure the reliability and security of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NewBlockHashesMessageSerializerTests` class?
- The `NewBlockHashesMessageSerializerTests` class is a test class that tests the functionality of the `NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer` class.

2. What does the `Roundtrip` test do?
- The `Roundtrip` test creates a `NewBlockHashesMessage` object, serializes it using the `NewBlockHashesMessageSerializer`, and then deserializes it back into a `NewBlockHashesMessage` object to ensure that the serialization and deserialization process works correctly.

3. What is the purpose of the `To_string` test?
- The `To_string` test creates a `NewBlockHashesMessage` object and calls its `ToString` method to ensure that the method works correctly and returns a string representation of the object.
