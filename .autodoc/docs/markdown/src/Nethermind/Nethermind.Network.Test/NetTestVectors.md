The `NetTestVectors` class is a collection of static methods and fields that provide test vectors for network-related functionality in the Nethermind project. 

The `BuildSecretsWithSameIngressAndEgress` method returns an `EncryptionSecrets` object with the same AES and MAC secrets for ingress and egress. This method is used to test the `EncryptionSecrets` class, which is used to store the secrets used for encrypting and decrypting messages in the RLPx protocol.

The `GetSecretsPair` method returns a tuple of two `EncryptionSecrets` objects that are generated using the `EncryptionHandshake` class. This method is used to test the `EncryptionHandshake` class, which is used to perform the key exchange and generate the encryption secrets for the RLPx protocol.

The `StaticKeyA`, `StaticKeyB`, `EphemeralKeyA`, `EphemeralPublicKeyA`, `EphemeralKeyB`, `EphemeralPublicKeyB`, `NonceA`, and `NonceB` fields are used as test vectors for the `EncryptionHandshake` class.

The `AesSecret` and `MacSecret` fields are used as test vectors for the `EncryptionSecrets` class.

The `BIngressMacFoo` field is used as a test vector for the `KeccakHash` class, which is used to compute the MAC for incoming messages in the RLPx protocol.

The `AuthEip8` and `AckEip8` fields are used as test vectors for the `Packet` class, which is used to represent RLPx packets. These test vectors are used to test the EIP-8 compatibility of the RLPx protocol.

Overall, the `NetTestVectors` class provides a set of test vectors that are used to ensure the correctness and compatibility of the network-related functionality in the Nethermind project. These test vectors are used in unit tests and integration tests throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NetTestVectors` class?
- The `NetTestVectors` class contains static methods and fields that provide test vectors for network-related functionality in the `nethermind` project.

2. What is the significance of the `BuildSecretsWithSameIngressAndEgress` method?
- The `BuildSecretsWithSameIngressAndEgress` method builds an `EncryptionSecrets` object with the same AES and MAC secrets for both ingress and egress. This is useful for testing scenarios where the same secrets are used for both directions of communication.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetSecretsPair` method?
- The `GetSecretsPair` method generates a pair of `EncryptionSecrets` objects using the `EncryptionHandshake` class and verifies that they are identical. This is useful for testing scenarios where two parties need to establish a shared secret for secure communication.
