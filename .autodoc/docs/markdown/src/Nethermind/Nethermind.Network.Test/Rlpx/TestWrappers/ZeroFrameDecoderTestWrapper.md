The `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class is a wrapper around the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class, which is part of the RLPx networking protocol implementation in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a way to test the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class in isolation, without having to set up a full RLPx network stack.

The `ZeroFrameDecoder` class is responsible for decoding RLPx frames, which are used to transmit messages between nodes in the Ethereum network. The `Decode` method in the `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class takes an input `IByteBuffer` and returns the decoded message as an `IByteBuffer`. The `throwOnCorruptedFrames` parameter controls whether the method should throw an exception if the input contains a corrupted frame.

The `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class overrides the `_context` field of the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class with a `Substitute` object, which allows the `Decode` method to be called without requiring a real `IChannelHandlerContext` object. The `PooledByteBufferAllocator.Default` is used as the buffer allocator for the `Substitute` object.

Overall, the `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class provides a convenient way to test the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class in isolation, which can be useful for debugging and testing purposes. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
var decoder = new ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper(frameCipher, frameMacProcessor);
var input = Unpooled.WrappedBuffer(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 });
var output = decoder.Decode(input);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class?
    
    The `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class is a wrapper around the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class that allows for testing of the `Decode` method.

2. What is the significance of the `IFrameCipher` and `FrameMacProcessor` parameters in the constructor?
    
    The `IFrameCipher` and `FrameMacProcessor` parameters are dependencies required by the `ZeroFrameDecoder` class, which the `ZeroFrameDecoderTestWrapper` class is wrapping.

3. What is the purpose of the `Decode` method and what does it return?
    
    The `Decode` method decodes a given `IByteBuffer` input and returns the decoded `IByteBuffer` result, or null if there is no result. It also has an optional parameter `throwOnCorruptedFrames` which determines whether a `CorruptedFrameException` should be thrown if a corrupted frame is encountered.
