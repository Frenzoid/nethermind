The code provided is a test file for the `SizeExtensions` class in the Nethermind project. The `SizeExtensions` class is responsible for providing extension methods to convert between different units of data size, such as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes. The purpose of this test file is to ensure that the `GB()` extension method for `long` and `int` data types does not cause an overflow exception when converting a large number of bytes to gigabytes.

The `SizeExtensionsTests` class contains two test methods, `CheckOverflow_long` and `CheckOverflow_int`, which take a single parameter of type `long` and `int`, respectively. These parameters represent the number of bytes to be converted to gigabytes using the `GB()` extension method. The test methods use the `Assert.IsTrue()` method to verify that the result of the `GB()` method is greater than or equal to zero, indicating that no overflow exception was thrown during the conversion.

The `TestCase` attribute is used to specify the input values for the test methods. The first test case has an input value of zero, which is the smallest possible value for the `long` and `int` data types. The second test case has an input value of 1000, which is equivalent to 1 kilobyte. The third test case has an input value of 9223372036 for `long` and 2147483647 for `int`, which are the largest possible values for these data types divided by 1 billion and 1 million, respectively. These test cases cover the range of input values that the `GB()` method is expected to handle without causing an overflow exception.

Overall, this test file ensures that the `GB()` extension method for `long` and `int` data types in the `SizeExtensions` class is working correctly and can handle large input values without causing an overflow exception. This is important for the larger Nethermind project, which deals with large amounts of data and requires accurate and efficient data size conversions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SizeExtensionsTests` class?
- The `SizeExtensionsTests` class is a test fixture for testing the `CheckOverflow_long` and `CheckOverflow_int` methods of the `SizeExtensions` class.

2. What is the `GB()` method doing?
- The `GB()` method is an extension method that converts a number to gigabytes.

3. What is the purpose of the `Assert.IsTrue()` statements in the test methods?
- The `Assert.IsTrue()` statements are used to verify that the result of calling the `GB()` method on the test case is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that there is no overflow.
