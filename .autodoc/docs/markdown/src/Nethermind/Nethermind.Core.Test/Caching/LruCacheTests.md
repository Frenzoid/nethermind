The `LruCacheTests` class is a test suite for the `LruCache` class, which is a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache implementation. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `LruCache` class behaves as expected in various scenarios.

The `LruCache` class is a generic class that takes two type parameters: `TKey` and `TValue`. It implements the `ICache<TKey, TValue>` interface, which defines methods for getting, setting, and deleting items from the cache. The `LruCache` class uses a dictionary to store the cached items, and a doubly linked list to keep track of the order in which the items were accessed.

The `LruCacheTests` class contains several test methods that cover different scenarios. The `At_capacity` test method tests whether the cache behaves correctly when it is at capacity. The test sets items in the cache until it is full, and then retrieves an item that was added earlier to ensure that the least recently used item was evicted.

The `Can_reset` test method tests whether the cache can be reset by setting an item to a new value. The test sets an item in the cache, sets it to a new value, and then retrieves it to ensure that the new value was stored.

The `Can_ask_before_first_set` test method tests whether the cache returns null when an item is requested that has not been set. The test requests an item that has not been set and ensures that null is returned.

The `Can_clear` test method tests whether the cache can be cleared. The test sets an item in the cache, clears the cache, and then retrieves the item to ensure that it was removed.

The `Beyond_capacity` test method tests whether the cache behaves correctly when it is beyond capacity. The test sets items in the cache until it is full, and then sets additional items to ensure that the least recently used items were evicted.

The `Can_set_and_then_set_null` test method tests whether the cache can store null values. The test sets an item to a non-null value, sets it to null, and then retrieves it to ensure that null is returned.

The `Can_delete` test method tests whether items can be deleted from the cache. The test sets an item in the cache, deletes it, and then retrieves it to ensure that null is returned.

The `Clear_should_free_all_capacity` test method tests whether the cache is completely cleared when the `Clear` method is called. The test sets items in the cache, clears the cache, and then sets new items to ensure that the cache is completely empty.

The `Delete_keeps_internal_structure` test method tests whether the cache's internal structure is maintained when items are deleted. The test sets items in the cache and deletes some of them, and then retrieves the remaining items to ensure that they are still in the cache.

The `Wrong_capacity_number_at_constructor` test method tests whether an exception is thrown when an invalid capacity is passed to the `LruCache` constructor.

Overall, the `LruCacheTests` class provides comprehensive test coverage for the `LruCache` class, ensuring that it behaves correctly in various scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a test suite for a caching implementation in the Nethermind project.

2. What type of caching is being tested?
- The test suite is testing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation.

3. What is the expected behavior when the cache is full and a new item is added?
- When the cache is full and a new item is added, the least recently used item should be evicted to make room for the new item.
