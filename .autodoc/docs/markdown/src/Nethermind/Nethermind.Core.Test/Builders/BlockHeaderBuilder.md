The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class is a builder for creating instances of the `BlockHeader` class. The `BlockHeader` class represents the header of a block in a blockchain. The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for setting the various properties of a `BlockHeader` instance. 

The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class inherits from the `BuilderBase<BlockHeader>` class, which provides a `TestObjectInternal` property that holds the `BlockHeader` instance being built. The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class overrides the `BeforeReturn` method of the `BuilderBase<BlockHeader>` class to calculate the hash of the `BlockHeader` instance being built, unless the `WithHash` method has been called to set the hash explicitly.

The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class has a constructor that initializes the `TestObjectInternal` property with default values for the various properties of a `BlockHeader` instance. The default values are as follows:

- ParentHash: the hash of the parent block
- UnclesHash: the hash of the uncles list
- Beneficiary: the address that will receive the block reward
- Difficulty: the difficulty of the block
- Number: the number of the block
- GasLimit: the gas limit of the block
- GasUsed: the amount of gas used by the transactions in the block
- Timestamp: the timestamp of the block
- ExtraData: extra data associated with the block
- MixHash: the mix hash of the block
- Nonce: the nonce of the block
- ReceiptsRoot: the root hash of the receipts trie
- StateRoot: the root hash of the state trie
- TxRoot: the root hash of the transactions trie

The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class provides methods for setting the various properties of a `BlockHeader` instance. These methods return the `BlockHeaderBuilder` instance to allow for method chaining. The methods are as follows:

- `WithParent`: sets the parent block header and updates the number and gas limit of the block header
- `WithParentHash`: sets the parent block hash
- `WithHash`: sets the block hash explicitly and prevents the hash from being calculated
- `WithUnclesHash`: sets the hash of the uncles list
- `WithBeneficiary`: sets the address that will receive the block reward
- `WithAuthor`: sets the address of the block author
- `WithBloom`: sets the bloom filter of the block
- `WithBaseFee`: sets the base fee per gas of the block
- `WithStateRoot`: sets the root hash of the state trie
- `WithTransactionsRoot`: sets the root hash of the transactions trie
- `WithReceiptsRoot`: sets the root hash of the receipts trie
- `WithDifficulty`: sets the difficulty of the block
- `WithNumber`: sets the number of the block
- `WithTotalDifficulty`: sets the total difficulty of the block
- `WithGasLimit`: sets the gas limit of the block
- `WithGasUsed`: sets the amount of gas used by the transactions in the block
- `WithTimestamp`: sets the timestamp of the block
- `WithExtraData`: sets the extra data associated with the block
- `WithMixHash`: sets the mix hash of the block
- `WithNonce`: sets the nonce of the block
- `WithAura`: sets the AuRa step and signature of the block
- `WithWithdrawalsRoot`: sets the root hash of the withdrawals trie
- `WithExcessDataGas`: sets the excess data gas of the block

Overall, the `BlockHeaderBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `BlockHeader` class with various properties set to specific values. This is useful for testing and other scenarios where a `BlockHeader` instance needs to be created with specific values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockHeaderBuilder` class?
- The `BlockHeaderBuilder` class is used to build instances of `BlockHeader` objects for testing purposes.

2. What is the significance of the `DefaultDifficulty` field?
- The `DefaultDifficulty` field is a static field that sets the default difficulty value for a `BlockHeader` instance to 1,000,000.

3. What is the purpose of the `BeforeReturn` method?
- The `BeforeReturn` method is called before returning a `BlockHeader` instance and is used to calculate the hash of the `BlockHeader` object if `_doNotCalculateHash` is false.
