The `BlockTreeBuilder` class is a builder for creating a `BlockTree` object, which is a data structure used to represent a blockchain. The `BlockTree` object is used in the Nethermind project to store and manage blocks and headers in the blockchain.

The `BlockTreeBuilder` class provides methods for building a `BlockTree` object with a specified number of blocks and headers. It also allows for the creation of blocks with transactions and receipts, which are stored in a receipt storage object.

The `BlockTreeBuilder` class has several public methods that can be used to configure the `BlockTree` object. These methods include:

- `OfHeadersOnly`: sets the `onlyHeaders` flag to true, which indicates that only block headers will be added to the `BlockTree` object.
- `OfChainLength`: adds blocks to the `BlockTree` object with a specified chain length.
- `WithOnlySomeBlocksProcessed`: adds blocks to the `BlockTree` object and updates the main chain with only a specified number of blocks.
- `WithBlocks`: adds a specified list of blocks to the `BlockTree` object.
- `ExtendTree`: extends the `BlockTree` object with a specified number of blocks.

The `BlockTreeBuilder` class also has private methods that are used to create blocks with transactions and receipts. These methods include:

- `CreateBlock`: creates a block with transactions and receipts.
- `WithTransactions`: sets the receipt storage object and a function for creating log entries for a block.

Overall, the `BlockTreeBuilder` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it provides a way to build and configure a `BlockTree` object, which is used to store and manage blocks and headers in the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockTreeBuilder` class?
- The `BlockTreeBuilder` class is a builder class that is used to create a `BlockTree` object, which is a data structure used to represent a blockchain.

2. What dependencies does the `BlockTreeBuilder` class have?
