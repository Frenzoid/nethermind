The `TransactionBuilder` class in the `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders` namespace is a utility class that provides a convenient way to create instances of the `Transaction` class. The `Transaction` class represents a transaction on the Ethereum network. Transactions are used to transfer ether or to execute smart contract functions. 

The `TransactionBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for setting the various properties of a transaction, such as the nonce, gas price, gas limit, recipient address, value, and data. It also provides methods for signing the transaction and calculating its hash. 

The `TransactionBuilder` class is intended to be used in unit tests and other scenarios where it is necessary to create transactions programmatically. By using the `TransactionBuilder`, developers can create transactions with specific properties and test how their code handles those transactions. 

Here is an example of how the `TransactionBuilder` can be used to create a transaction:

```
var builder = new TransactionBuilder<Transaction>();
var transaction = builder
    .WithNonce(1)
    .WithGasPrice(1000000000)
    .WithGasLimit(21000)
    .WithTo("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890")
    .WithValue(1000000000000000000)
    .WithData(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 })
    .SignedAndResolved(privateKey)
    .Build();
```

In this example, a new `TransactionBuilder` is created for the `Transaction` class. The various properties of the transaction are set using the fluent interface provided by the `TransactionBuilder`. Finally, the transaction is signed using the `SignedAndResolved` method and the `Build` method is called to create the transaction. 

Overall, the `TransactionBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create transactions programmatically and is a useful tool for testing Ethereum-related code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a TransactionBuilder class that allows developers to create and customize transactions for testing purposes in the Nethermind project.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and namespaces within the Nethermind project, including Nethermind.Core.Crypto, Nethermind.Core.Eip2930, Nethermind.Crypto, Nethermind.Int256, and Nethermind.Logging.

3. What is the difference between the `WithMaxFeePerGas` and `WithMaxPriorityFeePerGas` methods?
- The `WithMaxFeePerGas` method sets the maximum fee per gas for a transaction, while the `WithMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method sets the maximum priority fee per gas for a transaction. The priority fee is an optional fee that can be paid to incentivize miners to include the transaction in a block more quickly.
