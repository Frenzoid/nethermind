The `AccountBuilder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to create instances of the `Account` class. The `Account` class represents an Ethereum account and contains information such as the account's balance, nonce, code, and storage root. The purpose of the `AccountBuilder` class is to simplify the process of creating `Account` instances for testing purposes.

The `AccountBuilder` class inherits from the `BuilderBase<Account>` class, which provides a basic implementation for building objects. The `AccountBuilder` class has several methods that allow the user to set the balance, nonce, code, and storage root of the `Account` instance being built. These methods return the `AccountBuilder` instance itself, allowing for method chaining.

The `WithBalance` method takes a `UInt256` parameter and sets the balance of the `Account` instance being built to the provided value. The `WithNonce` method takes a `UInt256` parameter and sets the nonce of the `Account` instance being built to the provided value. The `WithCode` method takes a `byte[]` parameter and sets the code of the `Account` instance being built to the hash of the provided code using the `Keccak.Compute` method. The `WithStorageRoot` method takes a `Keccak` parameter and sets the storage root of the `Account` instance being built to the provided value.

Here is an example usage of the `AccountBuilder` class:

```
Account account = new AccountBuilder()
    .WithBalance(UInt256.Parse("1000000000000000000"))
    .WithNonce(UInt256.Parse("1"))
    .WithCode(new byte[] { 0x60, 0x60, 0x60 })
    .WithStorageRoot(Keccak.Compute(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 }))
    .Build();
```

This code creates a new `Account` instance with a balance of 1 ether, a nonce of 1, code of `0x606060`, and a storage root of the hash of `0x010203`. The `Build` method is called at the end to return the fully built `Account` instance.

Overall, the `AccountBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create `Account` instances with specific properties for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountBuilder` class?
- The `AccountBuilder` class is used to build instances of the `Account` class for testing purposes.

2. What is the significance of the `WithBalance`, `WithNonce`, `WithCode`, and `WithStorageRoot` methods?
- These methods are used to set specific properties of the `Account` object being built, such as the balance, nonce, code, and storage root.

3. What is the relationship between the `AccountBuilder` class and the `BuilderBase` class?
- The `AccountBuilder` class inherits from the `BuilderBase` class, which provides common functionality for building objects in a test environment.
