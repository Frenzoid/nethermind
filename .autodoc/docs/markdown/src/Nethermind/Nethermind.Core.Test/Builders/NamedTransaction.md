The `NamedTransaction` class is a subclass of the `Transaction` class and is used in the testing of the `Nethermind` project. It adds a `Name` property to the `Transaction` class, which is a string that can be used to identify the transaction. The `Name` property is set to `null!`, which means that it is guaranteed to be non-null at runtime.

The `NamedTransaction` class also overrides the `ToString()` method to return the `Name` property, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

The `[DebuggerDisplay(nameof(Name))]` attribute is used to specify how the object should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it will display the value of the `Name` property.

This class can be used in unit tests to create transactions with specific names, which can be useful for testing scenarios where transactions need to be identified by name. For example, if a test requires two transactions with different names, the `NamedTransaction` class can be used to create those transactions:

```
NamedTransaction tx1 = new NamedTransaction { Name = "Transaction 1" };
NamedTransaction tx2 = new NamedTransaction { Name = "Transaction 2" };
```

Overall, the `NamedTransaction` class is a simple extension of the `Transaction` class that adds a `Name` property and overrides the `ToString()` method. It can be used in testing scenarios where transactions need to be identified by name.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NamedTransaction` class and how does it differ from the `Transaction` class it inherits from?
- The `NamedTransaction` class is a subclass of `Transaction` and adds a `Name` property that can be set and retrieved. It also overrides the `ToString()` method to return the `Name` property.

2. Why is the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute used on the `NamedTransaction` class?
- The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to customize the display of the object in the debugger. In this case, it specifies that the display should show the value of the `Name` property.

3. What is the purpose of the SPDX license identifier at the top of the file?
- The SPDX license identifier is a standardized way of indicating the license under which the code is released. In this case, it indicates that the code is licensed under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
