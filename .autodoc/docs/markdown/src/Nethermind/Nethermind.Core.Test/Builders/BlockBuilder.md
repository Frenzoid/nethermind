The `BlockBuilder` class is a utility class that provides methods for building instances of the `Block` class. The `Block` class represents a block in the Ethereum blockchain. The `BlockBuilder` class is used to create instances of the `Block` class for testing purposes.

The `BlockBuilder` class provides methods for setting various properties of the `Block` class, such as the block number, gas limit, timestamp, transactions, and so on. These methods return the `BlockBuilder` instance, which allows for method chaining.

For example, the following code creates a new `BlockBuilder` instance and sets the block number, gas limit, and timestamp:

```
Block block = new BlockBuilder()
    .WithNumber(12345)
    .WithGasLimit(1000000)
    .WithTimestamp(1630000000)
    .Build();
```

The `Build` method creates a new instance of the `Block` class with the properties set by the `BlockBuilder` methods.

The `BlockBuilder` class also provides methods for setting the transactions and receipts of the block. These methods take an array of `Transaction` or `TxReceipt` objects, respectively.

The `BlockBuilder` class is used in the Nethermind project for testing purposes. It allows developers to create instances of the `Block` class with specific properties for testing various scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockBuilder` class?
    
    The `BlockBuilder` class is used to build instances of the `Block` class, which represents a block in the Ethereum blockchain.

2. What are some of the methods available in the `BlockBuilder` class?
    
    Some of the methods available in the `BlockBuilder` class include `WithHeader`, `WithNumber`, `WithGasLimit`, `WithTimestamp`, `WithTransactions`, `WithBeneficiary`, `WithDifficulty`, `WithParent`, `WithUncles`, and `WithStateRoot`. These methods allow developers to customize the properties of the `Block` instance being built.

3. What is the purpose of the `BeforeReturn` method in the `BlockBuilder` class?
    
    The `BeforeReturn` method in the `BlockBuilder` class is used to set the `Hash` property of the `BlockHeader` instance to the calculated hash value before returning the `Block` instance.
