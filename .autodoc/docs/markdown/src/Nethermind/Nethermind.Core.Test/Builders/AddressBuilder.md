The `AddressBuilder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to generate instances of the `Address` class. The `Address` class represents an Ethereum address and is used extensively throughout the Nethermind project. The `AddressBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `Address` class for use in testing and other scenarios.

The `AddressBuilder` class inherits from the `BuilderBase<Address>` class, which provides a base implementation for building instances of the `Address` class. The `AddressBuilder` class adds additional functionality to the base class by providing a way to generate random instances of the `Address` class and to create instances of the `Address` class from a given integer value.

The `AddressBuilder` class uses the `CryptoRandom` class from the `Nethermind.Crypto` namespace to generate random byte arrays that are used to create instances of the `Address` class. The `FromNumber` method of the `AddressBuilder` class takes an integer value and converts it to a big-endian byte array before padding it to a length of 20 bytes. This byte array is then used to create an instance of the `Address` class.

Here is an example of how the `AddressBuilder` class can be used to create an instance of the `Address` class:

```
AddressBuilder builder = new AddressBuilder();
Address randomAddress = builder.Build();
Address numberAddress = builder.FromNumber(12345).Build();
```

In the above example, the `AddressBuilder` class is used to create two instances of the `Address` class. The first instance is created using a random byte array, while the second instance is created using the integer value 12345. These instances can then be used in testing or other scenarios where an `Address` object is required.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AddressBuilder` class?
   - The `AddressBuilder` class is a builder class used for constructing instances of the `Address` class.
   
2. What is the significance of the `ICryptoRandom` interface and `CryptoRandom` field?
   - The `ICryptoRandom` interface and `CryptoRandom` field are used for generating random bytes to be used in constructing instances of the `Address` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `FromNumber` method?
   - The `FromNumber` method is used to construct an instance of the `Address` class from an integer value, by converting the integer to a big-endian byte array and padding it to 20 bytes.
