The code above is a test file for the `TransactionEipsSupport` class in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace. The purpose of this class is to determine whether a given transaction type supports certain Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). 

The `TransactionEipsSupportTests` class contains a single test method called `When_eip_defines_new_tx_type_then_previous_eips_are_supported`. This method takes in a `TxType` enum value and three boolean values that represent whether the transaction type supports EIP-2930, EIP-1559, and EIP-4844, respectively. The method creates a new `Transaction` object with the given `TxType` value and then checks whether the transaction supports each of the three EIPs by calling the corresponding properties on the `Transaction` object. Finally, the method uses NUnit's `Assert` class to verify that the actual values match the expected values.

This test method is designed to ensure that when a new transaction type is defined that supports a new EIP, the previous EIPs are still supported. The test achieves this by checking that the `Transaction` object correctly reports whether it supports each of the three EIPs for a given transaction type.

This test file is important for ensuring that the `TransactionEipsSupport` class is working correctly and that new transaction types are properly supported by the EIPs. It can be run as part of a larger suite of tests to ensure that the entire project is functioning as expected. 

Example usage of the `TransactionEipsSupport` class might involve checking whether a given transaction type supports a particular EIP before executing a smart contract that relies on that EIP. This would help ensure that the smart contract executes correctly and that the transaction is valid according to the Ethereum protocol.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionEipsSupportTests` class?
   - The `TransactionEipsSupportTests` class is a test fixture that contains a test method for checking whether a transaction type supports certain EIPs.

2. What is the significance of the `TestCase` attribute on the test method?
   - The `TestCase` attribute specifies multiple test cases with different input values for the `txType` parameter, allowing the test method to be executed with different transaction types.

3. What is the purpose of the `Assert` statements in the test method?
   - The `Assert` statements verify that the `Transaction` object created with the specified `txType` supports the expected EIPs, as defined by the boolean parameters passed to the `TestCase` attribute.
