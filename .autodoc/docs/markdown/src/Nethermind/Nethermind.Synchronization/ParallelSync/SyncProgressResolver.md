The `SyncProgressResolver` class is responsible for resolving the synchronization progress of the Nethermind node. It implements the `ISyncProgressResolver` interface and provides methods to find the best full state, best header, best full block, best processed block, chain difficulty, and total difficulty of a block. It also provides methods to check if the node is loading blocks from the database, if fast blocks headers, bodies, and receipts are finished, and if the snap get ranges are finished.

The `SyncProgressResolver` class takes in several dependencies such as `IBlockTree`, `IReceiptStorage`, `IDb`, `ITrieNodeResolver`, `ProgressTracker`, `ISyncConfig`, and `ILogManager`. These dependencies are used to resolve the synchronization progress of the node.

The `FindBestFullState` method searches for the best full state of the node. It first searches for the full state in the head block and then in the best suggested block. It returns the best full state found.

The `SearchForFullState` method searches for the full state of a block starting from the given block header. It searches for the full state in the block and its ancestors up to a maximum of 128 blocks back. It returns the block number of the best full state found.

The `FindBestHeader` method returns the block number of the best header of the node.

The `FindBestFullBlock` method returns the block number of the best full block of the node. It returns the minimum of the best header and the best suggested body block numbers.

The `IsLoadingBlocksFromDb` method returns a boolean indicating if the node is currently loading blocks from the database.

The `FindBestProcessedBlock` method returns the block number of the best processed block of the node. It returns the block number of the head block.

The `ChainDifficulty` property returns the total difficulty of the best suggested body block of the node.

The `GetTotalDifficulty` method returns the total difficulty of the block with the given hash. It first checks if the block is the best suggested block and returns its total difficulty. If not, it checks if the block is the parent of the best suggested block and returns the difference between the total difficulty of the best suggested block and its difficulty. If not, it searches for the block in the block tree and returns its total difficulty if found.

The `IsFastBlocksHeadersFinished`, `IsFastBlocksBodiesFinished`, and `IsFastBlocksReceiptsFinished` methods return a boolean indicating if the fast blocks headers, bodies, and receipts are finished downloading respectively. They return true if fast blocks are disabled or if the corresponding download is complete.

The `IsSnapGetRangesFinished` method returns a boolean indicating if the snap get ranges are finished. It checks the progress tracker to see if all the snap get ranges have been processed.

Overall, the `SyncProgressResolver` class provides methods to resolve the synchronization progress of the Nethermind node. It is used in the larger project to keep track of the synchronization progress and to determine if the node is fully synced.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncProgressResolver` class?
- The `SyncProgressResolver` class is responsible for resolving the progress of the synchronization process by providing information about the current state of the blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxLookupBack` constant?
- The `MaxLookupBack` constant is used to limit the number of blocks that the `SyncProgressResolver` class searches through when trying to find the best full state.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsFullySynced` method?
- The `IsFullySynced` method checks whether a given state root is fully synced by checking if it is in memory or has been saved in the database.
