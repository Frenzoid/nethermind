The code defines an abstract class called `ActivatedSyncFeed` that inherits from `SyncFeed` and implements the `IDisposable` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a base implementation for a synchronization feed that can be activated and deactivated based on the current synchronization mode. 

The class takes an `ISyncModeSelector` object as a constructor parameter, which is used to determine the current synchronization mode. The `SyncModeSelectorOnChanged` method is called whenever the synchronization mode changes, and it checks whether the feed should be activated or deactivated based on the new mode. If the feed should be activated, the `InitializeFeed` and `Activate` methods are called. If the feed should be deactivated, the `FallAsleep` method is called. 

The `ShouldBeActive` and `ShouldBeDormant` methods are used to determine whether the feed should be activated or deactivated based on the current synchronization mode. These methods check whether the feed is currently in the opposite state (active or dormant) and whether the current synchronization mode includes the activation sync modes defined by the derived class. 

The `OnStateChanged` method is called whenever the state of the feed changes, and it checks whether the new state is `SyncFeedState.Finished`. If it is, the `Dispose` method is called to clean up any resources used by the feed. 

The `ActivationSyncModes` property is an abstract property that must be implemented by any derived class. It defines the synchronization modes that should activate the feed. 

Overall, this class provides a flexible base implementation for a synchronization feed that can be activated and deactivated based on the current synchronization mode. It can be used as a building block for more complex synchronization logic in the larger project. 

Example usage:

```csharp
ISyncModeSelector syncModeSelector = new MySyncModeSelector();
ActivatedSyncFeed<MyData> myFeed = new MyActivatedSyncFeed(syncModeSelector);
myFeed.InitializeFeed();
syncModeSelector.SetSyncMode(SyncMode.Full);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ActivatedSyncFeed` class?
   - The `ActivatedSyncFeed` class is an abstract class that extends the `SyncFeed` class and implements the `IDisposable` interface. It provides functionality for managing the activation and deactivation of synchronization feeds based on the current sync mode.

2. What is the `ISyncModeSelector` interface and where is it defined?
   - The `ISyncModeSelector` interface is a dependency injected into the `ActivatedSyncFeed` constructor. It is not defined in this file and must be defined elsewhere in the `Nethermind` project.

3. What is the purpose of the `ActivationSyncModes` property?
   - The `ActivationSyncModes` property is an abstract property that must be implemented by derived classes. It returns a `SyncMode` value that determines which sync modes should activate the synchronization feed.
