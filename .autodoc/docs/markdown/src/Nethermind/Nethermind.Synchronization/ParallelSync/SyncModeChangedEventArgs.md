This code defines a class called `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to pass information about changes in synchronization mode between different components of the Nethermind project. 

The `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class has two properties: `Previous` and `Current`, both of which are of type `SyncMode`. The `SyncMode` enum is defined in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace and represents the different synchronization modes that can be used in the Nethermind project. 

The constructor of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class takes two arguments: `previous` and `current`, both of which are of type `SyncMode`. These arguments are used to set the values of the `Previous` and `Current` properties, respectively. 

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to notify other components of changes in synchronization mode. For example, if the synchronization mode changes from `Fast` to `Full`, an instance of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class can be created with the appropriate values and passed to any components that need to be notified of the change. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Nethermind project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Synchronization.ParallelSync;

public class SyncManager
{
    public event EventHandler<SyncModeChangedEventArgs> SyncModeChanged;

    private SyncMode _syncMode;

    public SyncMode SyncMode
    {
        get => _syncMode;
        set
        {
            if (_syncMode != value)
            {
                var args = new SyncModeChangedEventArgs(_syncMode, value);
                _syncMode = value;
                SyncModeChanged?.Invoke(this, args);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SyncManager` class has an event called `SyncModeChanged` that is raised whenever the synchronization mode changes. The `SyncMode` property of the `SyncManager` class is responsible for setting the synchronization mode and raising the `SyncModeChanged` event with an instance of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class. Other components of the Nethermind project can subscribe to this event to be notified of changes in synchronization mode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class?
- The `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` class is used to represent an event argument that contains information about a change in synchronization mode.

2. What is the `SyncMode` class and where is it defined?
- The `SyncMode` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace since it is being used in the `SyncModeChangedEventArgs` constructor.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file?
- The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
