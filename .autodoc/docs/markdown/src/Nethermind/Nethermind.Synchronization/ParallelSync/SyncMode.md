This code defines an enum called `SyncMode` and an extension method for it. The `SyncMode` enum is used to represent the different synchronization modes that can be used in the Nethermind project. Each mode is represented by a flag value, which is a power of 2. The different modes are:

- `None`: represents no synchronization mode.
- `WaitingForBlock`: represents a mode where the node is connected to other nodes and is waiting for new blocks to be discovered.
- `Disconnected`: represents a mode where the node is not connected to any other nodes.
- `FastBlocks`: represents a mode where the node is performing a fast sync by downloading headers, bodies, or receipts from a pivot block to the beginning of the chain in parallel.
- `FastSync`: represents a mode where the node is performing a standard fast sync before the peers head - 32 (threshold). This happens after the fast blocks finish downloading from the pivot downwards.
- `StateNodes`: represents a mode where the node is downloading all the trie nodes during fast sync. The node can switch between `StateNodes` and `FastSync` while catching up with the head - 32 due to peers not returning old trie nodes.
- `Full`: represents a mode where the node is performing a full archive sync from genesis or a full sync after `StateNodes` finish.
- `DbLoad`: represents a mode where the node is loading previously downloaded blocks from the database.
- `FastHeaders`: represents a mode where the node is downloading headers in parallel during fast sync.
- `FastBodies`: represents a mode where the node is downloading bodies in parallel during fast sync.
- `FastReceipts`: represents a mode where the node is downloading receipts in parallel during fast sync.
- `SnapSync`: represents a mode where the node is downloading state during snap sync (accounts, storages, code, proofs).
- `BeaconHeaders`: represents a mode where the node is performing a reverse download of headers from the beacon pivot to genesis.
- `All`: represents all synchronization modes.

The `SyncModeExtensions` class defines an extension method called `NotSyncing` that returns `true` if the `SyncMode` is either `WaitingForBlock` or `Disconnected`. This method can be used to check if the node is currently syncing or not.

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and manage different synchronization modes in the Nethermind project. It allows for flexibility in how the node can sync with the network and provides a way to check the current sync mode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncMode` enum?
    
    The `SyncMode` enum is used to represent the different synchronization modes that can be used in the Nethermind project, such as fast sync, full sync, and snap sync.

2. What is the `NotSyncing` extension method used for?
    
    The `NotSyncing` extension method is used to check if the current `SyncMode` is either `WaitingForBlock` or `Disconnected`, which indicates that the node is not currently syncing.

3. What is the purpose of the `All` value in the `SyncMode` enum?
    
    The `All` value in the `SyncMode` enum is used to represent all possible synchronization modes, and is a combination of all the other values in the enum using the bitwise OR operator.
