[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Synchronization/Peers/PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs.cs)

This code defines a class called `PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. The purpose of this class is to provide an event argument that can be used to notify subscribers when a new block is received from a peer during blockchain synchronization. 

The class has two properties: `SyncPeer` and `Block`. `SyncPeer` is of type `ISyncPeer` and represents the peer that sent the block. `Block` is of type `Block` and represents the block that was received. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to facilitate communication between different components involved in blockchain synchronization. When a new block is received from a peer, an event can be raised with an instance of `PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs` as the event argument. Subscribers to this event can then access the `SyncPeer` and `Block` properties to perform any necessary actions, such as validating the block or updating the local blockchain state. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
public class BlockchainSynchronizer
{
    public event EventHandler<PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs> BlockReceived;

    private void OnBlockReceived(ISyncPeer peer, Block block)
    {
        var args = new PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs(peer, block);
        BlockReceived?.Invoke(this, args);
    }
}
```

In this example, `BlockchainSynchronizer` is a class responsible for synchronizing the local blockchain with the network. When a new block is received from a peer, the `OnBlockReceived` method is called with the `ISyncPeer` and `Block` objects representing the peer and block, respectively. This method creates a new instance of `PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs` with these objects and raises the `BlockReceived` event with this instance as the event argument. Subscribers to this event can then access the `SyncPeer` and `Block` properties of the event argument to perform any necessary actions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a class called `PeerBlockNotificationEventArgs` that inherits from `EventArgs` and contains properties for a sync peer and a block.
