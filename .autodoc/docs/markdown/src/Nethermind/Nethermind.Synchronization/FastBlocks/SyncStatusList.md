The `SyncStatusList` class is a helper class used in the Nethermind project for synchronizing blocks between nodes. It maintains a list of block statuses and provides methods for marking blocks as inserted or unknown, as well as retrieving block information for a batch of blocks.

The class has three private fields: `_queueSize`, `_blockTree`, and `_statuses`. `_queueSize` is a long integer that represents the size of the queue of blocks waiting to be inserted. `_blockTree` is an instance of the `IBlockTree` interface, which represents a tree structure of blocks in the blockchain. `_statuses` is an instance of the `FastBlockStatusList` class, which is a custom list implementation that stores the status of each block.

The class has two public properties: `LowestInsertWithoutGaps` and `QueueSize`. `LowestInsertWithoutGaps` is a long integer that represents the lowest block number that has not yet been inserted without gaps. `QueueSize` is a long integer that represents the size of the queue of blocks waiting to be inserted.

The class has three public methods: `GetInfosForBatch`, `MarkInserted`, and `MarkUnknown`. `GetInfosForBatch` takes an array of nullable `BlockInfo` objects and fills in the missing ones with block information retrieved from the `_blockTree`. It also marks the retrieved blocks as `Sent` in the `_statuses` list. `MarkInserted` marks a block as inserted in the `_statuses` list and increments the `_queueSize`. `MarkUnknown` marks a block as unknown in the `_statuses` list.

The class is used in the larger Nethermind project to keep track of the status of blocks during synchronization between nodes. It is used in conjunction with other classes and interfaces to ensure that blocks are inserted in the correct order and that the synchronization process is efficient and reliable.

Example usage:

```
IBlockTree blockTree = new BlockTree();
SyncStatusList syncStatusList = new SyncStatusList(blockTree, 1000, null);

BlockInfo?[] blockInfos = new BlockInfo?[10];
syncStatusList.GetInfosForBatch(blockInfos);

syncStatusList.MarkInserted(1000);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall nethermind project?
- This code is part of the `nethermind` project and is related to fast block synchronization. It provides a `SyncStatusList` class that keeps track of the status of blocks during synchronization.

2. What is the significance of the `FastBlockStatusList` class and how is it used?
- The `FastBlockStatusList` class is used to keep track of the status of blocks during synchronization. It is used in conjunction with the `SyncStatusList` class to determine which blocks need to be synchronized.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetInfosForBatch` method and how is it used?
- The `GetInfosForBatch` method is used to retrieve block information for a batch of blocks. It takes an array of `BlockInfo` objects as input and fills in the missing information by querying the `_blockTree` object. It also updates the status of the blocks in the `_statuses` object.
