The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Nethermind.Synchronization.FastBlocks` namespace. This class is responsible for synchronizing transaction receipts for a batch of blocks. 

The class inherits from the `FastBlocksBatch` class, which provides a base implementation for synchronizing blocks quickly. The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class has two properties: `Infos` and `Response`. The `Infos` property is an array of `BlockInfo` objects that represent the blocks for which transaction receipts need to be synchronized. The `Response` property is an array of arrays of `TxReceipt` objects that represent the transaction receipts for each block in the batch. 

The constructor for the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class takes an array of `BlockInfo` objects as a parameter and initializes the `Infos` property with it. The `Response` property is set to `null` initially and can be set later when the transaction receipts are synchronized. 

This class can be used in the larger `Nethermind` project to synchronize transaction receipts for a batch of blocks quickly. For example, when a node receives a new block, it needs to synchronize the transaction receipts for that block to ensure that the transactions in the block are valid. The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class can be used to synchronize the transaction receipts for multiple blocks at once, which can improve the performance of the synchronization process. 

Here is an example of how the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class can be used in the `Nethermind` project:

```
BlockInfo[] blockInfos = new BlockInfo[] { blockInfo1, blockInfo2, blockInfo3 };
ReceiptsSyncBatch receiptsBatch = new ReceiptsSyncBatch(blockInfos);
// Synchronize transaction receipts for the batch of blocks
receiptsBatch.Sync();
// Get the transaction receipts for each block in the batch
TxReceipt[][] response = receiptsBatch.Response;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class?
- The `ReceiptsSyncBatch` class is a subclass of `FastBlocksBatch` and is used for synchronizing transaction receipts for a batch of blocks.

2. What is the significance of the `BlockInfo` and `TxReceipt` types?
- `BlockInfo` is a type from the `Nethermind.Core` namespace that contains information about a block, such as its hash and number. `TxReceipt` is a type that represents the receipt of a transaction, containing information such as the transaction's status and gas used.

3. Why are the `Response` property and the `TxReceipt` array nullable?
- The `Response` property is nullable because it may not be set until the batch is processed. The `TxReceipt` array is also nullable because there may not be any receipts for a given block, in which case the array would be null.
