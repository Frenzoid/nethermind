The `HeadersSyncBatch` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for synchronizing block headers between nodes in a fast and efficient manner. This class inherits from the `FastBlocksBatch` class and adds additional properties and methods specific to header synchronization.

The `StartNumber` property represents the block number from which the synchronization should start. The `RequestSize` property represents the number of headers to be requested in a single batch. The `EndNumber` property is a calculated property that returns the block number up to which headers should be requested based on the `StartNumber` and `RequestSize`.

The `Response` property is an array of nullable `BlockHeader` objects that represent the headers received in response to a synchronization request. The `ToString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `HeadersSyncBatch` object, which includes details such as the start and end block numbers, request size, prioritization, and timing information.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to efficiently synchronize block headers between nodes. By batching header requests and processing responses in parallel, the synchronization process can be optimized for speed and efficiency. The `HeadersSyncBatch` class provides a convenient way to manage and track header synchronization requests and responses. 

Example usage:

```csharp
HeadersSyncBatch syncBatch = new HeadersSyncBatch();
syncBatch.StartNumber = 1000;
syncBatch.RequestSize = 100;
Console.WriteLine(syncBatch.EndNumber); // Output: 1099
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HeadersSyncBatch` class?
- The `HeadersSyncBatch` class is a subclass of `FastBlocksBatch` and is used for synchronizing block headers.

2. What is the meaning of the `Response` property?
- The `Response` property is an array of nullable `BlockHeader` objects and is used to store the response received from the peer nodes during synchronization.

3. What is the significance of the `Prioritized` property in the `ToString` method?
- The `Prioritized` property is used to determine whether the synchronization request is high or low priority, and is included in the output of the `ToString` method for debugging purposes.
