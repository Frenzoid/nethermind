The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for dispatching requests to synchronize block bodies with peers. It extends the `SyncDispatcher` class and takes in a `ISyncFeed`, `ISyncPeerPool`, `IPeerAllocationStrategyFactory`, and `ILogManager` as parameters in its constructor. 

The `Dispatch` method is the main method of the class and is responsible for sending requests to peers to synchronize block bodies. It takes in a `PeerInfo`, `BodiesSyncBatch`, and `CancellationToken` as parameters. The `PeerInfo` contains information about the peer that the request is being sent to, the `BodiesSyncBatch` contains information about the block bodies that need to be synchronized, and the `CancellationToken` is used to cancel the request if needed.

The method first gets the `ISyncPeer` from the `PeerInfo` and sets the `ResponseSourcePeer` property of the `BodiesSyncBatch` to the `PeerInfo`. It then creates a list of `Keccak` hashes from the `BlockHash` property of the `Infos` property of the `BodiesSyncBatch`. If there are no hashes in the list, the method returns. Otherwise, it sends a request to the peer to get the block bodies using the `GetBlockBodies` method and passes in the list of hashes and the cancellation token. If a `TimeoutException` is thrown, the method returns. If the request takes longer than 1000ms, a debug message is logged.

Overall, the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it is responsible for synchronizing block bodies with peers. It uses the `SyncDispatcher` class to dispatch requests to peers and handles any exceptions that may occur during the process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class?
- The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class is a subclass of `SyncDispatcher` that handles dispatching batches of block bodies to peers during fast block synchronization.

2. What dependencies does the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class have?
- The `BodiesSyncDispatcher` class depends on an `ISyncFeed` of `BodiesSyncBatch` objects, an `ISyncPeerPool`, an `IPeerAllocationStrategyFactory` of `BodiesSyncBatch` objects, and an `ILogManager`.

3. What happens if the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` attempts to send a request with no hash?
- If the `BodiesSyncDispatcher` attempts to send a request with no hash, it logs a debug message and returns without dispatching the batch.
