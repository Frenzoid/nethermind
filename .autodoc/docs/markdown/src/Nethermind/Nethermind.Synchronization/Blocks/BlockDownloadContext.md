The `BlockDownloadContext` class is part of the Nethermind project and is used to manage the download of blocks from a peer node. It is responsible for storing the downloaded blocks and receipts, validating the receipts, and mapping the downloaded blocks to their corresponding indices.

The class takes in a `ISpecProvider` object, a `PeerInfo` object, an array of `BlockHeader` objects, a boolean flag indicating whether to download receipts, and an `IReceiptsRecovery` object. It then initializes a dictionary to map the indices of the downloaded blocks to their corresponding indices in the `Blocks` array, and a list of non-empty block hashes. If receipts are to be downloaded, it also initializes a two-dimensional array to store the receipts for each block.

The `GetHashesByOffset` method returns a list of block hashes starting from a given offset and up to a maximum length. The `SetBody` method sets the body of a block at a given index, and the `TrySetReceipts` method attempts to set the receipts for a block at a given index. If receipts are successfully set, the method validates the receipts and stores them in the `ReceiptsForBlocks` array.

The `GetBlockByRequestIdx` method returns the block at a given index, and the `ValidateReceipts` method validates the receipts for a given block by computing the receipts root and comparing it to the receipts root stored in the block header.

Overall, the `BlockDownloadContext` class provides a convenient way to manage the download of blocks and receipts from a peer node, and to validate the downloaded receipts. It is used in the larger Nethermind project to synchronize the blockchain with other nodes on the network. Below is an example of how the `BlockDownloadContext` class can be used to download blocks from a peer node:

```csharp
var specProvider = new MainnetSpecProvider();
var syncPeer = new PeerInfo("127.0.0.1", 30303);
var headers = await GetBlockHeadersFromPeer(syncPeer);
var downloadContext = new BlockDownloadContext(specProvider, syncPeer, headers, true, new ReceiptsRecovery());
var hashesToRequest = downloadContext.GetHashesByOffset(0, 10);
var blocks = await DownloadBlocksFromPeer(syncPeer, hashesToRequest);
for (int i = 0; i < blocks.Length; i++)
{
    downloadContext.SetBody(i, blocks[i].Body);
    if (downloadContext.ReceiptsForBlocks != null)
    {
        downloadContext.TrySetReceipts(i, blocks[i].Receipts, out _);
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockDownloadContext` class?
- The `BlockDownloadContext` class is used to store information related to downloading blocks, including block headers, bodies, and receipts.

2. What is the significance of the `downloadReceipts` parameter in the constructor?
- The `downloadReceipts` parameter is used to determine whether receipts should be downloaded along with the block bodies. If `true`, the `ReceiptsForBlocks` property will be initialized to an array of `TxReceipt` arrays.

3. What is the purpose of the `SetBody` method?
- The `SetBody` method is used to set the body of a block at a specific index. It takes an index and a `BlockBody` object as parameters, and replaces the body of the corresponding block in the `Blocks` array. If the `BlockBody` object is `null`, an `EthSyncException` is thrown.
