The `Timeouts` class in the `Nethermind.Synchronization` namespace is responsible for defining and providing access to two static `TimeSpan` objects: `Eth` and `RefreshDifficulty`. These objects represent the time intervals for two different synchronization-related tasks in the Nethermind project.

The `Eth` `TimeSpan` object is set to 10 seconds and is likely used as a timeout value for Ethereum-related operations. For example, if a node is waiting for a response from another node in the network, it may set a timeout of 10 seconds using the `Eth` value to ensure that it does not wait indefinitely for a response.

The `RefreshDifficulty` `TimeSpan` object is set to 8 seconds and is likely used as a time interval for refreshing the difficulty of the blockchain. The difficulty of the blockchain is a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block, and it needs to be adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block time. The `RefreshDifficulty` value may be used to determine how often the difficulty should be recalculated.

By defining these timeout and interval values in a separate class, the code that uses them can easily access and use them without having to hardcode the values directly in the code. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Example usage of these values in code:

```
// Wait for a response for up to 10 seconds
var response = await WaitForResponseAsync(Timeouts.Eth);

// Refresh the difficulty every 8 seconds
while (true)
{
    await Task.Delay(Timeouts.RefreshDifficulty);
    RefreshDifficulty();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Timeouts` class?
   - The `Timeouts` class is used to define static `TimeSpan` fields for different timeouts in the Nethermind synchronization module.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What are the values of the `Eth` and `RefreshDifficulty` fields?
   - The `Eth` field has a value of `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)`, which represents a timeout of 10 seconds. The `RefreshDifficulty` field has a value of `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(8)`, which represents a timeout of 8 seconds.
