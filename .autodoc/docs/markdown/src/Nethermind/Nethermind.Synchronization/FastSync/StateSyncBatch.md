The `StateSyncBatch` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is used in the `FastSync` module. This class is responsible for managing a batch of state sync requests and responses. 

The `StateSyncBatch` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `stateRoot`, `nodeDataType`, and `requestedNodes`. `stateRoot` is an instance of the `Keccak` class, which represents the root hash of the state trie. `nodeDataType` is an instance of the `NodeDataType` enum, which specifies the type of data being requested. `requestedNodes` is a list of `StateSyncItem` objects, which represent the nodes being requested.

The `StateSyncBatch` class has several properties. `NodeDataType` is a read-only property that returns the `NodeDataType` enum value passed to the constructor. `StateRoot` is a public property that returns the `Keccak` instance passed to the constructor. `RequestedNodes` is a nullable list of `StateSyncItem` objects that represents the nodes being requested. `Responses` is a nullable array of byte arrays that represents the responses received for the requested nodes. `ConsumerId` is an integer that represents the ID of the consumer that is processing the batch.

The `ToString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `StateSyncBatch` object. The string returned by this method contains the number of state sync requests and responses in the batch.

Overall, the `StateSyncBatch` class is an important component of the `FastSync` module in the `Nethermind` project. It provides a way to manage batches of state sync requests and responses, which is essential for efficient synchronization of the Ethereum blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StateSyncBatch` class?
   - The `StateSyncBatch` class is used for state synchronization during fast sync in the Nethermind project. It contains information about requested nodes, responses, and the current assigned peer.
2. What is the `Keccak` class used for?
   - The `Keccak` class is used for cryptographic hashing in the Nethermind project. It is used to calculate the state root in the `StateSyncBatch` constructor.
3. What is the purpose of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute?
   - The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to customize the display of the `StateSyncBatch` object in the debugger. It shows the number of requested nodes, responses, and the current assigned peer.
