The `StateSyncDispatcher` class is responsible for dispatching state sync requests to peers in the Nethermind project. It extends the `SyncDispatcher` class and overrides its `Dispatch` method to handle state sync requests. 

When a state sync request is received, the `Dispatch` method checks if the requested nodes are null or empty. If so, it returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it checks if the peer supports the `GETNODEDATA` protocol. If it does, it creates a `HashList` object and calls the `GetNodeData` method on the peer to retrieve the requested nodes. If the peer does not support `GETNODEDATA`, it checks if it supports the `SNAP` protocol. If it does, it creates a `GetTrieNodesRequest` object and calls the appropriate method on the `ISnapSyncPeer` object to retrieve the requested nodes. If the peer does not support either protocol, it throws an `InvalidOperationException`.

The `GetGroupedRequest` method is used to group storage requests by account path using the `SNAP` protocol. This grouping decreases the size of the requests. The method creates a `GetTrieNodesRequest` object and populates its `AccountAndStoragePaths` property with the grouped requests. It also updates the `RequestedNodes` property of the `StateSyncBatch` object with the correct order of the requested nodes.

The `EncodePath` method is used to encode a byte array as a compact hex string or a nibble array depending on its length.

The `HashList` class is used to present an array of `StateSyncItem` objects as an `IReadOnlyList<Keccak>` to avoid allocating a secondary array. It also rents and returns a cache for a single item to try and avoid allocating the `HashList` in the common case.

Overall, the `StateSyncDispatcher` class plays a crucial role in the state sync process of the Nethermind project by dispatching state sync requests to peers and handling the responses.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StateSyncDispatcher` class?
- The `StateSyncDispatcher` class is responsible for dispatching state sync requests to peers and handling the responses.

2. What protocols are used to retrieve requested nodes, and in what order?
- The `GETNODEDATA` protocol is used if the peer supports it, otherwise the `SNAP` protocol is used. If the requested nodes are code, the `GetByteCodes` method is called, otherwise the `GetTrieNodes` method is called.

3. What is the purpose of the `HashList` class?
- The `HashList` class is used to present an array of `StateSyncItem` objects as an `IReadOnlyList<Keccak>` to avoid allocating a secondary array. It also rents and returns a cache for a single item to try and avoid allocating the `HashList` in the common case.
