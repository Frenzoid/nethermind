The `MemoryAllowance` class is a static class that defines a single public static field called `FastBlocksMemory`. This field is of type `ulong` and is initialized to a value of 128 MB using the `MB()` extension method from the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace.

The purpose of this class is to provide a configurable memory allowance for fast block synchronization in the Nethermind project. Fast block synchronization is a feature that allows nodes to quickly synchronize with the network by downloading only the most recent blocks instead of the entire blockchain. This can be useful for nodes that have fallen behind or are joining the network for the first time.

By default, the `FastBlocksMemory` field is set to 128 MB, but it can be changed by modifying the value of the field. For example, if a user wants to increase the memory allowance to 256 MB, they can simply set `MemoryAllowance.FastBlocksMemory = (ulong)256.MB();`.

Overall, the `MemoryAllowance` class is a small but important part of the Nethermind project that allows for flexible configuration of fast block synchronization memory usage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemoryAllowance` class?
   - The `MemoryAllowance` class is used to define a static variable `FastBlocksMemory` that represents the amount of memory allocated for fast blocks in the Nethermind synchronization process.

2. What is the significance of the `(ulong)128.MB()` expression?
   - The expression `(ulong)128.MB()` is used to convert the value of 128 megabytes into an unsigned long integer, which is then assigned to the `FastBlocksMemory` variable. This value represents the amount of memory allocated for fast blocks in the synchronization process.
