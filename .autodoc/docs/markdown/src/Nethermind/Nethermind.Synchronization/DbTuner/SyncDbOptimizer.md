The `SyncDbTuner` class is responsible for tuning the database used in the synchronization process of the Nethermind blockchain. The class receives four database objects as constructor parameters: `_stateDb`, `_codeDb`, `_blockDb`, and `_receiptDb`. It also receives three synchronization feed objects: `snapSyncFeed`, `bodiesSyncFeed`, and `receiptSyncFeed`. The class subscribes to the `StateChanged` event of each feed object and calls the `Tune` method of the corresponding database object when the feed state changes to `Active`. The `Tune` method is called with the `_tuneType` parameter, which is set to the `TuneDbMode` property of the `syncConfig` object passed as a constructor parameter.

The `SyncDbTuner` class is used in the larger project to optimize the database performance during the synchronization process. The `Tune` method of the database objects adjusts the database parameters based on the `_tuneType` parameter. The `TuneType` enumeration has three values: `Default`, `Fast`, and `Slow`. The `Default` value sets the database parameters to their default values. The `Fast` value optimizes the database for fast write operations, and the `Slow` value optimizes the database for slow write operations.

The `SyncDbTuner` class is an example of how the Nethermind project uses events and database tuning to optimize the performance of the blockchain synchronization process. Here is an example of how the `SyncDbTuner` class can be used in the project:

```csharp
var syncConfig = new SyncConfig { TuneDbMode = ITunableDb.TuneType.Fast };
var stateDb = new StateDb();
var codeDb = new CodeDb();
var blockDb = new BlockDb();
var receiptDb = new ReceiptDb();
var snapSyncFeed = new SnapSyncFeed();
var bodiesSyncFeed = new BodiesSyncFeed();
var receiptSyncFeed = new ReceiptSyncFeed();

var syncDbTuner = new SyncDbTuner(
    syncConfig,
    snapSyncFeed,
    bodiesSyncFeed,
    receiptSyncFeed,
    stateDb,
    codeDb,
    blockDb,
    receiptDb
);

// Start the synchronization process
// ...
``` 

In this example, the `SyncDbTuner` object is created with the `Fast` tuning mode. The synchronization process is started, and the `SyncDbTuner` object adjusts the database parameters to optimize the performance of the synchronization process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a class called `SyncDbTuner` that tunes the performance of different databases used in the synchronization process of the Nethermind blockchain.

2. What is the role of the `ITunableDb` interface?
   
   The `ITunableDb` interface is used to tune the performance of a database by changing its configuration parameters based on the current state of the synchronization process.

3. What are the different types of synchronization feeds used in this code?
   
   This code uses three different types of synchronization feeds: `SnapSyncBatch`, `BodiesSyncBatch`, and `ReceiptsSyncBatch`. These feeds are used to synchronize different types of data between different nodes in the blockchain network.
