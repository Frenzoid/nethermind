The `Pivot` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is used in the `SnapSync` module. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the best header of the blockchain and to provide a pivot header for the synchronization process. 

The `Pivot` class has a private field `_blockTree` of type `IBlockTree` which is used to get the best suggested header of the blockchain. It also has a private field `_bestHeader` of type `BlockHeader` which stores the best header of the blockchain. The `Diff` property returns the difference between the block number of the best suggested header and the block number of the `_bestHeader`. 

The constructor of the `Pivot` class takes an instance of `IBlockTree` and `ILogManager` as parameters. The `ILogManager` is used to get the logger instance for the class. 

The `GetPivotHeader` method returns the `_bestHeader` if it is null or the difference between the block number of the best suggested header and the block number of the `_bestHeader` is greater than or equal to `Constants.MaxDistanceFromHead - 35`. If the `_logger` is in debug mode, it checks if the state root of the current header is the same as the state root of the `_bestHeader`. If they are not the same, it logs a warning message. 

The `LogPivotChanged` method is a private method that logs an info message with the new pivot header and the difference between the block number of the new pivot header and the block number of the old pivot header. 

The `UpdateHeaderForcefully` method updates the `_bestHeader` if the block number of the best suggested header is greater than the block number of the `_bestHeader`. It logs a message if the update is due to too many empty responses. 

Overall, the `Pivot` class is an important part of the `SnapSync` module as it provides the pivot header for the synchronization process. It keeps track of the best header of the blockchain and updates it if necessary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Pivot` class?
    
    The `Pivot` class is used for managing the pivot header in the context of snap sync.

2. What is the `Diff` property used for?
    
    The `Diff` property is used to calculate the difference between the number of the best suggested header and the number of the current pivot header.

3. What is the significance of the `UpdateHeaderForcefully` method?
    
    The `UpdateHeaderForcefully` method is used to update the pivot header if there are too many empty responses.
