The `NullFilterStore` class is a part of the Nethermind blockchain project and implements the `IFilterStore` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a default implementation of the `IFilterStore` interface that does not support filter creation, saving, or removal. Instead, it returns empty collections or null values for filter retrieval methods. 

This class is useful in cases where a filter store is required, but the application does not need to create or save filters. For example, it can be used in testing scenarios where filter creation is not necessary, or in cases where the application does not require filter functionality at all.

The `NullFilterStore` class is a singleton, meaning that only one instance of this class can exist at a time. The constructor is private, and the only way to access an instance of this class is through the `Instance` property, which returns the single instance of the class.

The `NullFilterStore` class provides implementations for several methods of the `IFilterStore` interface. The `FilterExists` method always returns false, indicating that no filters exist in the store. The `GetFilters` method returns an empty collection of filters. The `GetFilter` method always returns null, indicating that no filter with the specified ID exists in the store. The `GetFilterType` method throws an exception, indicating that filter types are not supported by this implementation.

The `CreateBlockFilter`, `CreatePendingTransactionFilter`, `CreateLogFilter`, `SaveFilter`, and `RemoveFilter` methods all throw exceptions, indicating that filter creation, saving, and removal are not supported by this implementation.

Finally, the `FilterRemoved` event is implemented as an empty event, indicating that no subscribers are notified when a filter is removed from the store.

Overall, the `NullFilterStore` class provides a simple implementation of the `IFilterStore` interface that does not support filter creation, saving, or removal. It is useful in cases where filter functionality is not required or in testing scenarios where filter creation is not necessary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NullFilterStore` class?
    
    The `NullFilterStore` class is an implementation of the `IFilterStore` interface that does not support filter creation and always returns empty collections or null values for filter retrieval methods.

2. Why is the `Instance` property implemented as a static property with a private constructor?
    
    The `Instance` property is implemented as a static property with a private constructor to ensure that only one instance of the `NullFilterStore` class can exist in the application domain.

3. What is the purpose of the `FilterRemoved` event and why is it implemented with empty add and remove methods?
    
    The `FilterRemoved` event is raised when a filter is removed from the filter store. It is implemented with empty add and remove methods because the `NullFilterStore` class does not actually store any filters and therefore does not need to notify any subscribers of filter removals.
