The `FilterManager` class is responsible for managing filters in the Nethermind blockchain. Filters are used to query the blockchain for specific information, such as logs, blocks, and transactions. The class implements the `IFilterManager` interface, which defines the methods for managing filters.

The `FilterManager` class uses three concurrent dictionaries to store logs, block hashes, and pending transactions. It also uses an instance of `IFilterStore` to manage filters. The class subscribes to events from `IBlockProcessor` and `ITxPool` to receive notifications when new blocks and transactions are processed.

The `FilterManager` class provides several methods for querying filters. The `GetLogs` method returns an array of `FilterLog` objects for a given filter ID. The `GetBlocksHashes` method returns an array of block hashes for a given filter ID. The `PollBlockHashes` method returns an array of block hashes for a given filter ID and clears the list of block hashes. The `PollLogs` method returns an array of `FilterLog` objects for a given filter ID and clears the list of logs. The `PollPendingTransactionHashes` method returns an array of pending transaction hashes for a given filter ID and clears the list of pending transactions.

The `FilterManager` class also provides several private methods for adding logs, blocks, and transactions to filters. The `AddReceipts` method adds logs to log filters. The `AddBlock` method adds blocks to block filters. The `StoreLogs` method creates `FilterLog` objects for a given transaction receipt and adds them to log filters. The `CreateLog` method creates a `FilterLog` object for a given log entry and transaction receipt.

Overall, the `FilterManager` class is an important component of the Nethermind blockchain that enables clients to query the blockchain for specific information using filters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FilterManager` class?
- The `FilterManager` class is responsible for managing filters for logs, blocks, and pending transactions in the blockchain.

2. What are the parameters passed to the constructor of the `FilterManager` class?
- The `FilterManager` class constructor takes in an `IFilterStore` object, an `IBlockProcessor` object, an `ITxPool` object, and an `ILogManager` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `PollBlockHashes` method?
- The `PollBlockHashes` method is used to retrieve the block hashes for a given filter ID and clear the list of block hashes for that filter ID. If no block hashes are found for the given filter ID, it returns an empty array.
