The `DefaultHttpClient` class is a wrapper around the `HttpClient` class that provides additional functionality for making HTTP requests. It implements the `IHttpClient` interface and provides two methods for making HTTP requests: `GetAsync` and `PostJsonAsync`. 

The `GetAsync` method sends a GET request to the specified endpoint and returns the response as an object of type `T`. The `PostJsonAsync` method sends a POST request to the specified endpoint with the specified payload and returns the response as an object of type `T`. 

The class constructor takes an instance of `HttpClient`, an instance of `IJsonSerializer`, an instance of `ILogManager`, and two optional parameters: `retries` and `retryDelayMilliseconds`. The `HttpClient` instance is used to make the actual HTTP requests, the `IJsonSerializer` instance is used to serialize and deserialize JSON payloads, and the `ILogManager` instance is used to log messages. The `retries` parameter specifies the number of times to retry a failed request, and the `retryDelayMilliseconds` parameter specifies the delay between retries.

The `ExecuteAsync` method is a private method that is used by both `GetAsync` and `PostJsonAsync` to execute the HTTP requests. It takes a `Method` parameter that specifies the HTTP method to use (GET or POST), an endpoint string, an optional payload object, and an optional cancellation token. It first generates a unique request ID and then enters a loop that retries the request if it fails. The loop continues until either the request succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached. If the request fails, the method logs an error message and waits for the specified delay before retrying the request.

The `ProcessRequestAsync` method is a private method that is called by `ExecuteAsync` to actually send the HTTP request and process the response. It takes the same parameters as `ExecuteAsync` and returns an object of type `T`. It first serializes the payload object to a JSON string and then sends the HTTP request using the `HttpClient` instance. It logs the request and response messages and returns the deserialized response object if the request is successful.

Overall, the `DefaultHttpClient` class provides a simple and flexible way to make HTTP requests with retries and logging. It can be used in any part of the Nethermind project that requires HTTP communication, such as the JSON-RPC API implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultHttpClient` class?
- The `DefaultHttpClient` class is a proxy for HTTP requests that provides methods for sending GET and POST requests with JSON payloads, and supports retries with a configurable number of attempts and delay between attempts.

2. What is the purpose of the `_logger` field and how is it used?
- The `_logger` field is an instance of the `ILogger` interface from the `Nethermind.Logging` namespace, which is used to log messages at different levels of severity. It is used to log information about the HTTP requests and responses, as well as any errors that occur during the execution of the requests.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExecuteAsync` method and how does it work?
- The `ExecuteAsync` method is a private method that is used to execute an HTTP request with retries in case of failure. It takes a `Method` enum value that specifies whether the request is a GET or POST request, an endpoint URL, an optional payload object for POST requests, and an optional cancellation token. It generates a unique request ID, and then enters a loop that attempts to execute the request up to a configurable number of times. If the request succeeds, the method returns the deserialized response object. If the request fails after all retries, the method returns the default value for the response type.
