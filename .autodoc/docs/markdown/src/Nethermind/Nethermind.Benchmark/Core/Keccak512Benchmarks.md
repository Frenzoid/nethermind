The `Keccak512Benchmarks` class is a benchmarking tool for measuring the performance of the `Keccak512` hash function implementation in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this benchmark is to compare the performance of the current implementation of the `Keccak512` hash function with a new implementation that is being developed (`Improved()` method). The benchmark is performed on four different scenarios, which are represented by the `_scenarios` array. The scenarios include an empty byte array, a byte array with a single byte, a byte array with 100,000 bytes, and the byte representation of an Ethereum address.

The benchmarking tool uses the `BenchmarkDotNet` library to measure the execution time of the `Current()` and `Improved()` methods. The `Params` attribute is used to specify the index of the scenario to be used for each benchmark run. The `GlobalSetup` method is used to set up the `_a` byte array with the scenario data before each benchmark run.

The `Current()` method is the current implementation of the `Keccak512` hash function in the Nethermind project. It uses the `Keccak512.Compute()` method to compute the hash of the input byte array. The `Improved()` method is a placeholder for the new implementation of the `Keccak512` hash function that is being developed. It currently throws a `NotImplementedException`.

The `HashLib` method is commented out and not used in the benchmark. It is an alternative implementation of the `Keccak512` hash function using the `HashLib` library.

Overall, this benchmarking tool is used to measure the performance of the `Keccak512` hash function implementation in the Nethermind project and to compare it with a new implementation that is being developed. The results of this benchmark can be used to optimize the performance of the `Keccak512` hash function and improve the overall performance of the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a benchmark for the Keccak512 hash function implementation in the Nethermind project.

2. What other hash functions are implemented in the Nethermind project?
- It is unclear from this code which other hash functions are implemented in the Nethermind project.

3. Why is the `Improved` method throwing a `NotImplementedException`?
- It is unclear from this code why the `Improved` method is throwing a `NotImplementedException`. It is possible that this is a placeholder method that has not yet been implemented.
