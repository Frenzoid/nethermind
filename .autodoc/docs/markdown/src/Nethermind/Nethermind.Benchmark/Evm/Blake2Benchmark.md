The `Blake2Benchmark` class is a benchmarking tool for the Blake2 hash function implementation in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this code is to compare the performance of the current implementation of the Blake2 hash function with an improved version. 

The `Blake2Benchmark` class uses the `BenchmarkDotNet` library to run benchmarks on the `Current()` and `Improved()` methods. The `GlobalSetup` method is used to ensure that the results of the `Current()` and `Improved()` methods are equal. If they are not equal, an `InvalidBenchmarkDeclarationException` is thrown.

The `Current()` and `Improved()` methods both take a `byte[]` input and return a `Span<byte>` output. The `Span<byte>` type is used to represent a contiguous region of memory, which is useful for performance reasons. The `Blake2Compression` class is used to compress the input data into a 64-byte hash value.

The `Benchmark` attribute is used to mark the `Current()` method as the baseline method, which means that it will be used as a reference point for comparison with the `Improved()` method. The `Improved()` method is marked with the `Benchmark` attribute, which means that it will be benchmarked against the baseline method.

Overall, this code is used to benchmark the performance of the Blake2 hash function implementation in the Nethermind project. The results of the benchmark can be used to determine whether the improved implementation is faster or slower than the current implementation. This information can be used to optimize the implementation of the Blake2 hash function in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a benchmark for the Blake2Compression algorithm used in Nethermind's EVM implementation.

2. What is the difference between the `Current` and `Improved` methods?
   - The `Current` and `Improved` methods both use the same `_blake2Compression` object to compress the `input` byte array, but `Current` is marked as the baseline benchmark and `Improved` is not.

3. What happens in the `Setup` method?
   - The `Setup` method checks if the output of `Current` and `Improved` are equal using the `Bytes.AreEqual` method, and throws an exception if they are not.
