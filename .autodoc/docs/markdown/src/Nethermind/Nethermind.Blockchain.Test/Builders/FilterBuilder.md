The `FilterBuilder` class is a utility class that provides a convenient way to build `LogFilter` objects. `LogFilter` is a class that represents a filter for Ethereum logs. Ethereum logs are events that are emitted by smart contracts and can be used to track changes in the state of the blockchain.

The `FilterBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for building `LogFilter` objects. It has methods for setting the from and to block numbers, setting the address filter, and setting the topic filter. The `LogFilter` object can then be built using the `Build` method.

The `FilterBuilder` class has several methods for setting the from and to block numbers. These methods take a block number or a `BlockParameterType` enum value. The `BlockParameterType` enum represents special block numbers such as "latest", "earliest", "pending", and "future". The `FromBlock` and `ToBlock` methods can be used to set the range of blocks to filter.

The `FilterBuilder` class also has methods for setting the address filter. The `WithAddress` method takes an `Address` object and sets the filter to only include logs from that address. The `WithAddresses` method takes an array of `Address` objects and sets the filter to include logs from any of those addresses.

Finally, the `FilterBuilder` class has a method for setting the topic filter. The `WithTopicExpressions` method takes an array of `TopicExpression` objects and sets the filter to include logs that match any of those expressions.

Overall, the `FilterBuilder` class provides a convenient way to build `LogFilter` objects for filtering Ethereum logs. It can be used in the larger project to track changes in the state of the blockchain and to trigger actions based on those changes. Here is an example of how the `FilterBuilder` class can be used:

```
FilterBuilder.New()
    .FromBlock(BlockParameterType.Earliest)
    .ToBlock(BlockParameterType.Latest)
    .WithAddress(new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"))
    .WithTopicExpressions(new TopicExpression("Transfer(address,address,uint256)"))
    .Build();
```

This code creates a `LogFilter` object that filters logs from the address "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890" and matches the "Transfer" event with three parameters: "address", "address", and "uint256". The filter includes logs from the earliest block to the latest block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a `FilterBuilder` class that can be used to build a `LogFilter` object with various filter parameters.

2. What is the `LogFilter` class and what does it do?
   
   The `LogFilter` class is defined in another file and is used to filter logs from the blockchain based on various criteria such as block range, address, and topics.

3. What is the purpose of the `New` methods in the `FilterBuilder` class?
   
   The `New` methods are used to create a new instance of the `FilterBuilder` class with a unique ID. The `New(ref int currentFilterIndex)` method can be used to specify the starting ID value.
