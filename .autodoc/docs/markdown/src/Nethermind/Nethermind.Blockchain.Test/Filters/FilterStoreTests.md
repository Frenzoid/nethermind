The `FilterStoreTests` class is a test suite for the `FilterStore` class in the Nethermind project. The `FilterStore` class is responsible for managing filters that are used to query the blockchain for specific events. The `FilterStoreTests` class tests the functionality of the `FilterStore` class by creating and saving different types of filters and verifying that they can be retrieved and removed correctly.

The `FilterStoreTests` class contains several test methods that test different aspects of the `FilterStore` class. The `Can_save_and_load_block_filter` method tests the ability of the `FilterStore` class to create and save a block filter. The `Can_save_and_load_log_filter` method tests the ability of the `FilterStore` class to create and save a log filter. The `Cannot_overwrite_filters` method tests that the `FilterStore` class throws an exception when attempting to save a filter with the same ID as an existing filter. The `Ids_are_incremented_when_storing_externally_created_filter` method tests that the `FilterStore` class correctly increments the ID of a filter that is created externally and then saved. The `Remove_filter_removes_and_notifies` method tests that the `FilterStore` class correctly removes a filter and notifies subscribers of the removal. The `Can_get_filters_by_type` method tests that the `FilterStore` class correctly retrieves filters of a specific type.

The `Correctly_creates_address_filter` and `Correctly_creates_topics_filter` methods test that the `FilterStore` class correctly creates address and topics filters, respectively. These methods use test cases to verify that the filters are created correctly for different input parameters.

Overall, the `FilterStoreTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it ensures that the `FilterStore` class is functioning correctly and can be relied upon to manage filters for querying the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FilterStore` class?
- The `FilterStore` class is used to create, save, and manage different types of filters, such as block filters and log filters, for the Nethermind blockchain.

2. What is the purpose of the `Can_get_filters_by_type` test?
- The `Can_get_filters_by_type` test checks if the `FilterStore` class can correctly retrieve filters of a specific type, such as `LogFilter` or `BlockFilter`, and return them as an array.

3. What is the purpose of the `Correctly_creates_address_filter` test?
- The `Correctly_creates_address_filter` test checks if the `FilterStore` class can correctly create an `AddressFilter` object based on the input parameters, such as a single address or an array of addresses.
