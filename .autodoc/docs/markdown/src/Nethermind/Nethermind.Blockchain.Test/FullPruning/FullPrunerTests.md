The `FullPrunerTests` class is a test suite for the `FullPruner` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `FullPruner` class is responsible for pruning the blockchain data in the `Nethermind` node. Pruning is the process of removing old and unnecessary data from the blockchain to reduce the storage requirements of the node. The `FullPrunerTests` class tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class by simulating different scenarios and verifying the expected behavior.

The `FullPrunerTests` class contains several test methods that test different aspects of the `FullPruner` class. The `can_prune` method tests whether the `FullPruner` class can successfully prune the blockchain data. The `pruning_deletes_old_db_on_success` method tests whether the old database is deleted after successful pruning. The `pruning_keeps_old_db_on_fail` method tests whether the old database is kept when pruning fails. The `pruning_deletes_new_db_on_fail` method tests whether the new database is deleted when pruning fails. The `pruning_keeps_new_db_on_success` method tests whether the new database is kept after successful pruning. The `can_not_start_pruning_when_other_is_in_progress` method tests whether pruning can be started when another pruning process is already in progress. The `should_not_start_multiple_pruning` method tests whether multiple pruning processes can be started simultaneously. The `should_duplicate_writes_while_pruning` method tests whether writes to the database are duplicated while pruning. The `should_duplicate_writes_to_batches_while_pruning` method tests whether writes to the database batches are duplicated while pruning.

Each test method creates a `TestContext` object that contains the necessary objects for testing. The `TestContext` object contains a `FullPruningDb` object, which is a subclass of the `FullPruner` class. The `TestContext` object also contains a `TrieDb` object, which is a database that stores the blockchain data. The `TestContext` object creates a `Pruner` object, which is an instance of the `FullPruner` class. The `Pruner` object is responsible for pruning the blockchain data.

The `TestContext` object also contains methods for adding blocks to the blockchain and waiting for pruning to complete. The `AddBlocks` method adds blocks to the blockchain. The `WaitForPruning` method waits for pruning to complete and returns a boolean value indicating whether pruning was successful. The `WaitForPruningEnd` method waits for pruning to complete and returns a boolean value indicating whether pruning was successful. The `WaitForPruningStart` method waits for pruning to start and returns a `TestFullPruningDb.TestPruningContext` object, which is a subclass of the `IPruningContext` interface.

The `TestFullPruningDb` class is a subclass of the `FullPruningDb` class. The `TestFullPruningDb` class overrides the `TryStartPruning` method to return a `TestPruningContext` object instead of the default `PruningContext` object. The `TestFullPruningDb` class also overrides the `ClearOldDb` method to set a `WaitForClearDb` event when the old database is cleared.

Overall, the `FullPrunerTests` class tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class by simulating different scenarios and verifying the expected behavior. The `TestContext` object contains the necessary objects for testing, and the `TestFullPruningDb` class is a subclass of the `FullPruningDb` class that provides additional functionality for testing.
## Questions:
