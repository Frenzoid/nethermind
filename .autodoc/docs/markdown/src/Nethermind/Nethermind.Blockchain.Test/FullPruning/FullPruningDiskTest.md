The `FullPruningDiskTest` class is a test suite for the `FullPruner` class in the `Nethermind.Blockchain.FullPruning` namespace. The `FullPruner` class is responsible for pruning the state trie of the Ethereum blockchain, which is a process of removing old and unused data from the trie to reduce its size and improve performance. The `FullPruningDiskTest` class tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class by creating a test blockchain and running pruning on it multiple times.

The `FullPruningDiskTest` class contains a nested class called `PruningTestBlockchain`, which extends the `TestBlockchain` class and adds additional properties and methods for testing pruning. The `PruningTestBlockchain` class has a `PruningDb` property, which is an instance of the `IFullPruningDb` interface that represents the database used for full pruning. It also has a `TempDirectory` property, which is an instance of the `TempPath` class that represents a temporary directory used for testing. The `PruningTrigger` property is an instance of the `IPruningTrigger` interface that represents the trigger for pruning. The `FullPruner` property is an instance of the `FullTestPruner` class, which extends the `FullPruner` class and adds a `WaitHandle` property that is a `ManualResetEvent` used for signaling when pruning is finished. The `PruningConfig` property is an instance of the `IPruningConfig` interface that represents the configuration for pruning.

The `FullPruningDiskTest` class has two test methods: `prune_on_disk_multiple_times` and `prune_on_disk_only_once`. Both methods create an instance of the `PruningTestBlockchain` class with different configurations for pruning. The `prune_on_disk_multiple_times` method runs pruning three times with a minimum delay of 0 hours between each run, while the `prune_on_disk_only_once` method runs pruning three times with a minimum delay of 10 hours between each run. The `RunPruning` method is called in both test methods to run pruning on the blockchain. The `RunPruning` method adds blocks to the blockchain, triggers pruning, waits for pruning to finish, and checks the state of the database after pruning. If `onlyFirstRuns` is true, the method only checks the state of the database after the first run.

The `WriteFileStructure` method is a helper method that writes the file structure of the state database to the console for debugging purposes.

Overall, the `FullPruningDiskTest` class tests the functionality of the `FullPruner` class by creating a test blockchain and running pruning on it multiple times with different configurations. The test methods check that pruning is working correctly by verifying the state of the database after pruning.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FullPruningDiskTest` class?
- The `FullPruningDiskTest` class is a test class that contains two test methods for testing full pruning on disk.

2. What is the `FullTestPruner` class and what is its purpose?
- The `FullTestPruner` class is a subclass of `FullPruner` that adds a `WaitHandle` property and overrides the `RunPruning` method to set the `WaitHandle` after pruning. Its purpose is to allow waiting for pruning to finish in tests.

3. What is the purpose of the `RunPruning` method and what does it do?
- The `RunPruning` method is a private method that is called by the test methods to run pruning on the blockchain. It adds blocks to the blockchain, triggers pruning, waits for pruning to finish, and checks the state database for expected changes.
