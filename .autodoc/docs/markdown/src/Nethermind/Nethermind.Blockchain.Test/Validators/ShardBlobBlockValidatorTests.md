The `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class contains unit tests for the `BlockValidator` class, which is responsible for validating blocks in the Nethermind blockchain. The tests cover various scenarios related to the validation of suggested blocks.

The first test, `Not_null_ExcessDataGas_is_invalid_pre_cancun()`, checks whether a block with non-null `ExcessDataGas` is invalid before the Cancun fork. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a custom specification provider and LimboLogs logger, and then attempts to validate a block with a withdrawals root, a withdrawal, and an `ExcessDataGas` value of 1. The test expects the validation to fail, which is asserted using the `Assert.False()` method.

The second test, `Null_ExcessDataGas_is_invalid_post_cancun()`, is similar to the first test, but it checks whether a block with null `ExcessDataGas` is invalid after the Cancun fork. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a custom specification provider and LimboLogs logger, and then attempts to validate a block with a withdrawals root and a withdrawal. The test expects the validation to fail, which is asserted using the `Assert.False()` method.

The third test, `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid()`, checks whether the number of blobs in a block is valid. The test creates a `BlockValidator` instance with a custom specification provider and LimboLogs logger, and then attempts to validate a block with a withdrawals root, a withdrawal, an `ExcessDataGas` value of 1, and a variable number of transactions with blob versioned hashes. The test expects the validation to pass if the number of blobs is less than or equal to the maximum allowed by the EIP-4844 specification, and to fail otherwise. The test uses the `TestCase` attribute to run multiple test cases with different numbers of blobs and expected results.

Overall, these tests ensure that the `BlockValidator` class correctly validates suggested blocks according to the Nethermind specification. The tests cover different scenarios related to the Cancun fork and the maximum number of blobs per block, which are important features of the Nethermind blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class?
- The `ShardBlobBlockValidatorTests` class contains test methods for validating suggested blocks with different parameters.

2. What is the significance of the `CustomSpecProvider` and `BlockValidator` classes?
- The `CustomSpecProvider` class provides a custom specification for the blockchain, while the `BlockValidator` class validates suggested blocks based on the provided specification.

3. What is the purpose of the `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid` test method?
- The `Blobs_per_block_count_is_valid` test method checks whether the number of blobs in a suggested block is valid based on the provided specification.
