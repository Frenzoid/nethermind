The code is a unit test for a class called `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` in the `Nethermind.Blockchain.Producers` namespace. The purpose of this class is to trigger block production every time a new transaction is added to the transaction pool. This is achieved by subscribing to the `NewPending` event of the transaction pool and raising a `TriggerBlockProduction` event every time the `NewPending` event is raised.

The `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class takes an `ITxPool` object as a constructor parameter. The `ITxPool` interface represents a transaction pool and is used to manage pending transactions. In the unit test, a substitute object of `ITxPool` is created using the `Substitute.For` method from the `NSubstitute` library. This substitute object is used to simulate the behavior of a real transaction pool.

The unit test method is called `On_pending_trigger_works` and it tests whether the `TriggerBlockProduction` event is raised every time a new transaction is added to the transaction pool. The test creates an instance of the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class using the substitute `ITxPool` object. It then subscribes to the `TriggerBlockProduction` event and adds two new transactions to the transaction pool using the `Raise.EventWith` method from the `NSubstitute` library. Finally, the test checks whether the `TriggerBlockProduction` event was raised twice by asserting that the `triggered` variable is equal to 2.

This unit test ensures that the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class is working correctly and that it is triggering block production every time a new transaction is added to the transaction pool. This is an important feature of the Nethermind blockchain as it ensures that new blocks are produced in a timely manner and that transactions are processed efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a test for the `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` class in the `Nethermind.Blockchain.Producers` namespace.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file has dependencies on `FluentAssertions`, `Nethermind.Consensus.Producers`, `Nethermind.Core.Test.Builders`, `Nethermind.TxPool`, `NSubstitute`, and `NUnit.Framework`.

3. What does the `On_pending_trigger_works` test do?
- The `On_pending_trigger_works` test checks that the `TriggerBlockProduction` event of a `BuildBlockOnEachPendingTx` instance is triggered twice when two new pending transactions are added to the associated `ITxPool`.
