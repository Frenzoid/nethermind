The `MevBundleRpc` class is a data structure used in the Nethermind project to represent a bundle of transactions that are part of a MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategy. MEV refers to the amount of value that can be extracted from a block by reordering transactions or including additional transactions. This class contains properties that define the bundle of transactions, including the transactions themselves, the block number they belong to, and optional timestamps and reverting transaction hashes.

The `Txs` property is an array of byte arrays that represent the transactions in the bundle. The `BlockNumber` property is a long integer that specifies the block number that the transactions belong to. The `MinTimestamp` and `MaxTimestamp` properties are optional `UInt256` values that represent the minimum and maximum timestamps for the transactions in the bundle. These timestamps can be used to filter out transactions that were not included in the block due to timestamp restrictions.

The `RevertingTxHashes` property is an optional array of `Keccak` hashes that represent transactions that were included in the block but later reverted due to a chain reorganization. These hashes can be used to identify transactions that were part of the MEV strategy but did not ultimately contribute to the final state of the block.

This class can be used in various parts of the Nethermind project where MEV strategies are implemented or analyzed. For example, it may be used in a transaction pool that prioritizes transactions based on their MEV potential or in a block explorer that displays MEV-related information for each block. Here is an example of how this class could be used to create a new MEV bundle:

```
var bundle = new MevBundleRpc
{
    Txs = new byte[][]
    {
        // byte arrays representing transactions in the bundle
    },
    BlockNumber = 12345,
    MinTimestamp = new UInt256(1630000000),
    MaxTimestamp = new UInt256(1631000000),
    RevertingTxHashes = new Keccak[]
    {
        // Keccak hashes representing reverting transactions
    }
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MevBundleRpc` class?
   - The `MevBundleRpc` class is used to represent a bundle of transactions along with some metadata related to the bundle.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` type used in the `RevertingTxHashes` property?
   - The `Keccak` type is used to represent the hash of a transaction that has been reverted.

3. Why are the `MinTimestamp` and `MaxTimestamp` properties nullable?
   - The `MinTimestamp` and `MaxTimestamp` properties are nullable to allow for cases where the bundle does not have a specific range of timestamps associated with it.
