The `CacheTests` class is a test suite for the `MemCountingCache` class, which is a cache implementation used in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `MemCountingCache` class works as expected and that its memory usage is calculated correctly.

The `CacheTests` class contains five test methods, each of which tests a different aspect of the `MemCountingCache` class. The first three tests (`Cache_initial_memory_calculated_correctly`, `Cache_post_init_memory_calculated_correctly`, and `Cache_post_capacity_growth_memory_calculated_correctly`) test the memory usage of the cache under different conditions. The fourth test (`Limit_by_memory_works_fine`) tests the cache's ability to limit its memory usage, while the fifth test (`Limit_by_memory_works_fine_wth_deletes`) tests the cache's ability to handle deletions.

Each test method creates an instance of the `MemCountingCache` class with a specific capacity and then performs a series of cache operations (e.g., `Set`, `Get`) to test the cache's behavior. The `FluentAssertions` library is used to make assertions about the cache's state after each operation.

Overall, the `CacheTests` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's testing infrastructure, as it ensures that the `MemCountingCache` class works correctly and meets the project's requirements for memory usage. Developers working on the Nethermind project can use this test suite to verify that changes to the `MemCountingCache` class do not introduce bugs or regressions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemCountingCache` class?
    
    The `MemCountingCache` class is used to create a cache that counts the memory size of its entries.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` class and its static property `Zero`?

    The `Keccak` class is used for cryptographic hashing, and its `Zero` property represents the hash value of an empty byte array.

3. What is the purpose of the `Limit_by_memory_works_fine` and `Limit_by_memory_works_fine_wth_deletes` tests?

    These tests are used to verify that the cache is correctly limiting its memory usage and evicting entries when necessary, both with and without deletions.
