The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for block preprocessing in the consensus module. The purpose of this class is to combine multiple block preprocessing steps into a single step. This is useful when there are multiple steps that need to be executed in a specific order to preprocess a block.

The class implements the `IBlockPreprocessorStep` interface, which defines the `RecoverData` method. This method is called by the consensus module to preprocess a block before it is added to the blockchain. The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class contains a linked list of `IBlockPreprocessorStep` objects, which are executed in the order they are added to the list.

The constructor of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class takes an array of `IBlockPreprocessorStep` objects as a parameter. These objects are added to the linked list in the order they are passed to the constructor. The `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods can be used to add additional preprocessing steps to the beginning or end of the linked list.

The `RecoverData` method of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class iterates over the linked list of preprocessing steps and calls the `RecoverData` method of each step in turn. This ensures that each preprocessing step is executed in the correct order.

Here is an example of how the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class can be used:

```
var step1 = new Step1();
var step2 = new Step2();
var step3 = new Step3();

var compositeStep = new CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep(step1, step2);
compositeStep.AddLast(step3);

var block = new Block();
compositeStep.RecoverData(block);
```

In this example, three preprocessing steps (`Step1`, `Step2`, and `Step3`) are combined into a single step using the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class. The `AddLast` method is used to add `Step3` to the end of the linked list. Finally, the `RecoverData` method of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class is called with a `Block` object as a parameter. This causes each preprocessing step to be executed in the correct order, with the output of each step being passed as input to the next step.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class?
   - The `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep` class is an implementation of the `IBlockPreprocessorStep` interface and is used to execute a list of `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances in sequence.

2. What is the significance of the `params` keyword in the constructor of `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep`?
   - The `params` keyword allows the constructor to accept a variable number of arguments of type `IBlockPreprocessorStep`, which are then added to the `_recoverySteps` list.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `AddFirst` and `AddLast` methods in `CompositeBlockPreprocessorStep`?
   - The `AddFirst` method adds an `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instance to the beginning of the `_recoverySteps` list, while the `AddLast` method adds an instance to the end of the list. These methods are used to modify the sequence in which the `IBlockPreprocessorStep` instances are executed.
