The code defines a class called `BuildBlocksWhenRequested` that implements the `IManualBlockProductionTrigger` interface. This class is responsible for triggering the production of new blocks in the Nethermind blockchain when requested. 

The `BuildBlock` method is the main method of the class and is responsible for building a new block. It takes in several parameters, including the parent header of the block, a cancellation token, a block tracer, and payload attributes. These parameters are optional and can be null. 

The method creates a new `BlockProductionEventArgs` object with the provided parameters and invokes the `TriggerBlockProduction` event with the `args` object. This event is used to notify other parts of the Nethermind system that a new block needs to be produced. 

The `BlockProductionEventArgs` object contains a `BlockProductionTask` property, which is a `Task` object that represents the asynchronous operation of building a new block. The `BuildBlock` method returns this `Task` object to the caller, allowing them to await the completion of the block production process. 

Overall, this class is a key component of the Nethermind blockchain system, as it allows for the production of new blocks when requested. Other parts of the system can subscribe to the `TriggerBlockProduction` event to be notified when a new block needs to be produced. 

Example usage:

```
var blockBuilder = new BuildBlocksWhenRequested();
var newBlock = await blockBuilder.BuildBlock(parentHeader: someHeader);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file contains a class called `BuildBlocksWhenRequested` which implements the `IManualBlockProductionTrigger` interface and provides a method to build a block when requested.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
   - This code file has dependencies on the `Nethermind.Core`, `Nethermind.Evm.Tracing`, and `Nethermind.Int256` namespaces.

3. What is the significance of the `BlockProductionEventArgs` class?
   - The `BlockProductionEventArgs` class is used to pass arguments related to block production, such as the parent header, cancellation token, block tracer, and payload attributes, to the `BuildBlock` method.
