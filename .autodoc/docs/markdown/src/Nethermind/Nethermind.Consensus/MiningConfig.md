The `MiningConfig` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to configure mining-related settings. It implements the `IMiningConfig` interface and provides properties to get and set various mining-related configurations. 

The `Enabled` property is a boolean value that determines whether mining is enabled or not. The `TargetBlockGasLimit` property is a nullable long value that represents the target gas limit for a block. The `MinGasPrice` property is a `UInt256` value that represents the minimum gas price for a transaction. The `RandomizedBlocks` property is a boolean value that determines whether blocks should be randomized or not. The `ExtraData` property is a string value that represents extra data that can be included in a block.

The `BlocksConfig` property is an instance of the `IBlocksConfig` interface and is used to get and set various block-related configurations. It is lazily initialized and returns an instance of the `BlocksConfig` class if it is null. The `BlocksConfig` class provides default values for various block-related configurations.

This class can be used to configure mining-related settings in the Nethermind project. For example, if a developer wants to enable mining and set a target gas limit for a block, they can use the following code:

```
var miningConfig = new MiningConfig();
miningConfig.Enabled = true;
miningConfig.TargetBlockGasLimit = 10000000;
```

This will enable mining and set the target gas limit for a block to 10,000,000.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `MiningConfig` that implements the `IMiningConfig` interface and provides getters and setters for various mining-related configuration options.

2. What is the `BlocksConfig` property and how is it initialized?
- The `BlocksConfig` property is an instance of the `IBlocksConfig` interface that is lazily initialized to a new instance of the `BlocksConfig` class if it is currently null.

3. What is the significance of the `TargetBlockGasLimit`, `MinGasPrice`, `RandomizedBlocks`, and `ExtraData` properties?
- These properties are all related to mining configuration options. `TargetBlockGasLimit` sets the target gas limit for new blocks, `MinGasPrice` sets the minimum gas price for transactions, `RandomizedBlocks` enables or disables randomized block creation, and `ExtraData` sets additional data to include in new blocks.
