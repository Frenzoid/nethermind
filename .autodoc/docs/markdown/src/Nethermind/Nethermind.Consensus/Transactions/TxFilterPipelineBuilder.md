The `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class is responsible for building a pipeline of transaction filters that can be used to validate transactions before they are included in a block. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to create a standard filtering pipeline that can be used across the Nethermind project.

The `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method is a static method that creates a standard filtering pipeline with three filters: `MinGasPriceTxFilter`, `BaseFeeTxFilter`, and `NullTxFilter`. These filters are added to the pipeline using the `WithMinGasPriceFilter`, `WithBaseFeeFilter`, and `WithNullTxFilter` methods respectively. The `MinGasPriceTxFilter` and `BaseFeeTxFilter` filters are used to validate the minimum gas price and base fee of a transaction respectively, while the `NullTxFilter` filter is used to allow all transactions to pass through the pipeline without any validation.

The `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class is designed to be extensible, allowing custom filters to be added to the pipeline using the `WithCustomTxFilter` method. This method takes an instance of an `ITxFilter` implementation and adds it to the pipeline.

The `Build` property returns the built pipeline as an instance of `ITxFilterPipeline`.

Overall, the `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` class provides a way to create a standard filtering pipeline for transaction validation that can be used across the Nethermind project. It also provides a way to extend the pipeline with custom filters if needed. An example usage of this class would be to create a standard filtering pipeline for validating transactions before they are included in a block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class `TxFilterPipelineBuilder` that can be used to create a standard transaction filtering pipeline for a blockchain node.
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on `Nethermind.Config`, `Nethermind.Core.Specs`, `Nethermind.Int256`, and `Nethermind.Logging` namespaces. It also requires an `ILogManager` instance, an `ISpecProvider` instance, and an `IBlocksConfig` instance to create a standard filtering pipeline.
3. What is the expected output of calling `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method?
   - The `CreateStandardFilteringPipeline` method returns an instance of `ITxFilterPipeline` that represents a standard transaction filtering pipeline for a blockchain node. The pipeline includes filters for minimum gas price and base fee, and can be customized with additional filters.
