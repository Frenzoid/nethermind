The `CompositeTxSource` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to combine multiple transaction sources into a single source. It implements the `ITxSource` interface, which defines a method to get transactions for a given block header and gas limit. 

The constructor of the `CompositeTxSource` class takes an array of `ITxSource` objects and initializes a list of transaction sources. The `Then` method adds a new transaction source to the list, while the `First` method inserts a new transaction source at the beginning of the list. 

The `GetTransactions` method iterates over the list of transaction sources and calls the `GetTransactions` method on each source to get a collection of transactions. It then yields each transaction to the caller. This allows the caller to get all transactions from all sources in a single collection. 

The `ToString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `CompositeTxSource` object. It returns a string that includes the name of the class and a comma-separated list of the transaction sources. 

This class can be used in the larger Nethermind project to combine multiple transaction sources, such as pending transactions and transactions from the mempool, into a single source. This can simplify the process of getting transactions for a given block header and gas limit, as the caller only needs to call the `GetTransactions` method on the `CompositeTxSource` object. 

Example usage:

```
var pendingTxSource = new PendingTxSource();
var mempoolTxSource = new MempoolTxSource();
var compositeTxSource = new CompositeTxSource(pendingTxSource, mempoolTxSource);

var blockHeader = new BlockHeader();
var gasLimit = 1000000;

var transactions = compositeTxSource.GetTransactions(blockHeader, gasLimit);
foreach (var tx in transactions)
{
    // process transaction
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeTxSource` class?
   - The `CompositeTxSource` class is an implementation of the `ITxSource` interface and provides a way to combine multiple transaction sources into a single source.

2. What parameters does the `CompositeTxSource` constructor take?
   - The `CompositeTxSource` constructor takes a variable number of `ITxSource` objects as parameters, which are used to initialize the `_transactionSources` list.

3. What is the purpose of the `Then` and `First` methods?
   - The `Then` method adds a new `ITxSource` to the end of the `_transactionSources` list, while the `First` method inserts a new `ITxSource` at the beginning of the list. These methods allow for dynamic modification of the transaction sources used by the `CompositeTxSource`.
