The `EthModuleBenchmarks` class is a benchmarking class that tests the performance of the `EthRpcModule` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `EthRpcModule` class is responsible for handling Ethereum JSON-RPC requests and returning the appropriate responses. 

The `GlobalSetup` method initializes the necessary components for the benchmarking process. It creates a `TestMemDbProvider` instance, which provides an in-memory database for the blockchain data. It then creates instances of various classes such as `ISpecProvider`, `StateProvider`, `StorageProvider`, `ChainLevelInfoRepository`, `BlockTree`, `TransactionProcessor`, `BlockProcessor`, `EthereumEcdsa`, `BlockchainProcessor`, `IBloomStorage`, `LogFinder`, `BlockchainBridge`, `GasPriceOracle`, `FeeHistoryOracle`, `IReceiptStorage`, `ISyncConfig`, and `EthSyncingInfo`. These classes are responsible for managing the blockchain data, processing transactions, validating blocks, and providing various other functionalities required for the Ethereum network. 

The `Current` method is the actual benchmarking method that measures the performance of the `eth_getBalance` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods of the `EthRpcModule` class. It calls these methods with the `Address.Zero` and `BlockParameter(1)` parameters respectively. The `Benchmark` attribute is used to mark this method as a benchmarking method. 

Overall, this class is used to measure the performance of the `EthRpcModule` class in handling Ethereum JSON-RPC requests. It initializes the necessary components required for the benchmarking process and measures the performance of the `eth_getBalance` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods. This benchmarking process helps to identify any performance bottlenecks in the `EthRpcModule` class and optimize it for better performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a benchmark for the EthRpcModule in the nethermind project, which measures the performance of the `eth_getBalance` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on various modules and classes from the nethermind project, including Blockchain, Consensus, Core, Crypto, Db, Evm, Facade, JsonRpc, Logging, State, TxPool, Wallet, and NSubstitute.

3. What is the expected output of the `Current` method?
- The `Current` method is not expected to produce any output, as it is simply calling the `eth_getBalance` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods of the `_ethModule` object as part of the benchmark. The purpose of the benchmark is to measure the performance of these methods, not to produce any specific output.
