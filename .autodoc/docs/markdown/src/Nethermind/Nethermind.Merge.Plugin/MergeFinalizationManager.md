The `MergeFinalizationManager` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is responsible for managing the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. It is implemented as a class that implements two interfaces: `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` and `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager`. 

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has two private fields: `_manualBlockFinalizationManager` and `_auRaBlockFinalizationManager`. The former is an instance of the `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface, while the latter is an instance of the `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface. The `HasAuRaFinalizationManager` property is a boolean that returns true if `_auRaBlockFinalizationManager` is not null.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has two public events: `BlocksFinalized` and `FinalizeEventArgs`. The `BlocksFinalized` event is raised when a block is finalized, while the `FinalizeEventArgs` event is used to pass information about the finalized block.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `manualBlockFinalizationManager`, `blockFinalizationManager`, and `poSSwitcher`. The `manualBlockFinalizationManager` parameter is an instance of the `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface, while the `blockFinalizationManager` parameter is an instance of the `IBlockFinalizationManager` interface. The `poSSwitcher` parameter is an instance of the `IPoSSwitcher` interface.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class has several methods that are used to manage the finalization of blocks. The `MarkFinalized` method is used to mark a block as finalized. The `GetLastLevelFinalizedBy` method is used to get the last level that was finalized by a given block hash. The `GetFinalizationLevel` method is used to get the finalization level for a given level. The `Dispose` method is used to dispose of the `MergeFinalizationManager` object.

The `MergeFinalizationManager` class also has two properties: `LastFinalizedHash` and `LastFinalizedBlockLevel`. The `LastFinalizedHash` property returns the last finalized hash, while the `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` property returns the last finalized block level.

Overall, the `MergeFinalizationManager` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it manages the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. It is used to ensure that blocks are finalized correctly and that the blockchain remains secure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall nethermind project?
- This code defines a class called `MergeFinalizationManager` that implements two interfaces related to block finalization in the nethermind blockchain. It is likely used to manage the finalization of blocks during the merge process in the nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface and how is it used in this code?
- The `IAuRaBlockFinalizationManager` interface is used to manage the finalization of blocks in the AuRa consensus algorithm, which is used in the nethermind blockchain. In this code, the `MergeFinalizationManager` class checks if an instance of this interface is available and uses it to manage block finalization if it is.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsPostMerge` property and how is it used in this code?
- The `IsPostMerge` property is used to determine if the current state of the blockchain is post-merge or not. It is set to true if the `TerminalBlockReached` event has been triggered by the `poSSwitcher` object passed to the constructor. This property is used to determine which block finalization manager to use in the `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` property getter and the `Dispose` method.
