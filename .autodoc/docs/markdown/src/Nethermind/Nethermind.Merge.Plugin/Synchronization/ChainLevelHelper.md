The `ChainLevelHelper` class is part of the Nethermind project and provides functionality to help synchronize the blockchain. The class implements the `IChainLevelHelper` interface, which defines two methods: `GetNextHeaders` and `TrySetNextBlocks`.

The `GetNextHeaders` method returns an array of `BlockHeader` objects, which represent the next headers to be downloaded. The method takes three parameters: `maxCount`, `maxHeaderNumber`, and `skipLastBlockCount`. `maxCount` specifies the maximum number of headers to return, `maxHeaderNumber` specifies the maximum header number to return, and `skipLastBlockCount` specifies the number of headers to skip. The method returns `null` if the starting point is `null`, or if the level or beacon main chain block is `null`. The method uses the `_blockTree` object to find the level and beacon main chain block, and then uses the `_beaconPivot` object to determine the total difficulty of the new header. The method then adds the new header to the `headers` list and returns the list as an array.

The `TrySetNextBlocks` method takes two parameters: `maxCount` and `context`. The method returns `false` if the `Blocks` array in the `context` object is empty, or if the first block in the `Blocks` array is a beacon header without a body. Otherwise, the method sets the body of each block in the `context` object using the `_blockTree` object and returns `true`.

The `ChainLevelHelper` constructor takes four parameters: `blockTree`, `beaconPivot`, `syncConfig`, and `logManager`. The constructor initializes the `_blockTree`, `_beaconPivot`, `_syncConfig`, and `_logger` objects with the corresponding parameters.

The `OnMissingBeaconHeader` method takes a `blockNumber` parameter and checks if the `_beaconPivot.ProcessDestination.Number` is greater than the `blockNumber`. If it is, the method sets the `_beaconPivot.ShouldForceStartNewSync` property to `true`.

The `GetStartingPoint` method returns the starting point for the next header download. The method uses the `_blockTree` object to find the beacon main chain block and then iterates through the headers until it finds a non-beacon header. The method returns `null` if the header is not found or if the parent block info is `null`.

The `GetBeaconMainChainBlockInfo` method takes a `startingPoint` parameter and returns the beacon main chain block for the specified `startingPoint`. The method uses the `_blockTree` object to find the level and beacon main chain block.

Overall, the `ChainLevelHelper` class provides functionality to help synchronize the blockchain by finding the next headers to download and setting the body of each block in the `context` object. The class uses the `_blockTree` and `_beaconPivot` objects to find the level and beacon main chain block, and the `_syncConfig` object to determine the total difficulty of the new header.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the `ChainLevelHelper` class and the `IChainLevelHelper` interface, which provide methods for getting the next block headers and setting the next blocks for synchronization.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code file has dependencies on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind` namespace, including `IBlockTree`, `ISyncConfig`, `ILogger`, `IBeaconPivot`, `BlockDownloadContext`, `BlockInfo`, `BlockHeader`, and `Block`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetStartingPoint` method?
- The `GetStartingPoint` method returns the number before the lowest beacon info where the forward beacon sync should start, or the latest block that was processed where we should continue processing. It is used to determine the starting point for getting the next block headers.
