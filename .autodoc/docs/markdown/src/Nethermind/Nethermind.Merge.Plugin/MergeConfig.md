The `MergeConfig` class is a configuration class that is used in the Nethermind project. It implements the `IMergeConfig` interface and provides properties that can be used to configure various aspects of the merge process. 

The `Enabled` property is a boolean value that determines whether the merge process is enabled or not. If it is set to `true`, the merge process will be enabled, otherwise it will be disabled.

The `FinalTotalDifficulty` property is a string that represents the total difficulty of the final block in the merge process. This property is used to determine the finality of the merge process.

The `TerminalTotalDifficulty` property is a string that represents the total difficulty of the terminal block in the merge process. This property is used to determine the terminality of the merge process.

The `TerminalBlockHash` property is a string that represents the hash of the terminal block in the merge process. This property is used to identify the terminal block.

The `TerminalBlockNumber` property is a long that represents the number of the terminal block in the merge process. This property is used to identify the terminal block.

The `SecondsPerSlot` property is an unsigned long that represents the number of seconds per slot in the merge process. This property is obsolete and should not be used. Instead, the `SecondsPerSlot` property in the `BlocksConfig` class should be used.

The `BuilderRelayUrl` property is a string that represents the URL of the builder relay in the merge process. This property is used to communicate with the builder relay.

The `PrioritizeBlockLatency` property is a boolean value that determines whether block latency should be prioritized in the merge process. If it is set to `true`, block latency will be prioritized, otherwise it will not be prioritized.

The `SweepMemory` property is a `GcLevel` enum that represents the level of garbage collection to be performed in the merge process. The default value is `GcLevel.Gen1`.

The `CompactMemory` property is a `GcCompaction` enum that represents whether memory should be compacted in the merge process. The default value is `GcCompaction.Yes`.

The `CollectionsPerDecommit` property is an integer that represents the number of garbage collections to perform before decommitting memory in the merge process. The default value is 75.

Overall, the `MergeConfig` class provides a way to configure various aspects of the merge process in the Nethermind project. Developers can use this class to customize the merge process to meet their specific needs. For example, they can enable or disable the merge process, set the total difficulty of the final and terminal blocks, prioritize block latency, and configure garbage collection and memory management.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MergeConfig` class?
    
    The `MergeConfig` class is used to store configuration settings related to the Nethermind Merge Plugin.

2. What is the meaning of the `Obsolete` attribute on the `SecondsPerSlot` property?
    
    The `Obsolete` attribute indicates that the `SecondsPerSlot` property is no longer recommended for use and has been replaced by the `BlocksConfig.SecondsPerSlot` property.

3. What is the purpose of the `SweepMemory`, `CompactMemory`, and `CollectionsPerDecommit` properties?
    
    These properties are related to garbage collection in the Nethermind Merge Plugin. `SweepMemory` determines the level of garbage collection to use, `CompactMemory` determines whether to compact memory during garbage collection, and `CollectionsPerDecommit` determines how many garbage collections should occur before memory is decommitted.
