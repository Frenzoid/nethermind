The code defines an interface called `IMergeConfig` that extends the `IConfig` interface. This interface is used to configure the Merge plugin in the Nethermind project. The Merge plugin is responsible for transitioning the Ethereum network from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). 

The `IMergeConfig` interface has several properties that can be used to configure the Merge plugin. The `Enabled` property is a boolean that determines whether the Merge plugin is enabled and whether bundles are allowed. The `FinalTotalDifficulty` property is a string that represents the final total difficulty of the last PoW block. The `TerminalTotalDifficulty` property is a string that represents the terminal total difficulty used for the transition process. The `TerminalBlockHash` property is a string that represents the terminal PoW block hash used for the transition process. The `TerminalBlockNumber` property is a long that represents the terminal PoW block number used for the transition process. The `SecondsPerSlot` property is a ulong that represents the number of seconds per slot. The `BuilderRelayUrl` property is a string that represents the URL to the Builder Relay. If set, Nethermind will send the blocks it builds to the relay. 

The `PrioritizeBlockLatency` property is a boolean that determines whether block EngineApi latency is reduced by disabling Garbage Collection during EngineApi calls. The `SweepMemory` property is a GcLevel that reduces memory usage by forcing Garbage Collection between EngineApi calls. The `CompactMemory` property is a GcCompaction that reduces process used memory. The `CollectionsPerDecommit` property is an integer that requests the GC to release process memory back to OS. 

Overall, the `IMergeConfig` interface provides a way to configure the Merge plugin in the Nethermind project. The properties can be set to customize the behavior of the plugin and ensure a smooth transition from PoW to PoS. 

Example usage:

```
IMergeConfig mergeConfig = new MergeConfig();
mergeConfig.Enabled = true;
mergeConfig.FinalTotalDifficulty = "1000000000000000000000000000";
mergeConfig.TerminalTotalDifficulty = "500000000000000000000000000";
mergeConfig.TerminalBlockHash = "0x1234567890abcdef";
mergeConfig.TerminalBlockNumber = 123456;
mergeConfig.SecondsPerSlot = 10;
mergeConfig.BuilderRelayUrl = "https://builderrelay.example.com";
mergeConfig.PrioritizeBlockLatency = true;
mergeConfig.SweepMemory = GcLevel.Gen1;
mergeConfig.CompactMemory = GcCompaction.Yes;
mergeConfig.CollectionsPerDecommit = 50;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IMergeConfig` interface?
- The `IMergeConfig` interface is used to define configuration items for the Merge plugin in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `FinalTotalDifficulty` and `TerminalTotalDifficulty` properties?
- `FinalTotalDifficulty` and `TerminalTotalDifficulty` are used for the transition process in the Merge plugin, with `FinalTotalDifficulty` representing the total difficulty of the last PoW block and `TerminalTotalDifficulty` representing the total difficulty used for the transition process.

3. What is the purpose of the `SweepMemory` property?
- The `SweepMemory` property is used to reduce memory usage by forcing garbage collection between EngineApi calls, with options for `NoGc`, `Gen0`, `Gen1`, and `Gen2`.
