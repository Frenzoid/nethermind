This code defines an interface and two enums related to garbage collection (GC) strategies. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for the larger project to implement different GC strategies and configure how often garbage collections occur, whether to start a no-GC region, and what level of GC and compaction to use.

The `IGCStrategy` interface defines three methods: `CollectionsPerDecommit`, `CanStartNoGCRegion()`, and `GetForcedGCParams()`. The `CollectionsPerDecommit` method returns an integer representing how many collections should occur before memory is decommitted. The `CanStartNoGCRegion()` method returns a boolean indicating whether a no-GC region can be started. The `GetForcedGCParams()` method returns a tuple containing a `GcLevel` and `GcCompaction` value, which represent the level of GC and whether compaction should be used.

The `GcLevel` enum defines four values: `NoGC`, `Gen0`, `Gen1`, and `Gen2`. These values represent the different levels of GC that can be used. `NoGC` indicates that no GC should occur, while `Gen0`, `Gen1`, and `Gen2` indicate the different generations of objects that should be collected.

The `GcCompaction` enum defines three values: `No`, `Yes`, and `Full`. These values represent whether compaction should be used during GC. `No` indicates that no compaction should occur, while `Yes` and `Full` indicate different levels of compaction that can be used.

Overall, this code provides a way for the larger project to implement and configure different GC strategies based on their specific needs. For example, if the project has a lot of short-lived objects, they may want to use a more aggressive GC strategy with more frequent collections and less compaction. On the other hand, if the project has a lot of long-lived objects, they may want to use a less aggressive GC strategy with fewer collections and more compaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.GC` namespace?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet what the purpose of the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.GC` namespace is. Further investigation into the project's documentation or other related code files may be necessary to determine its purpose.

2. What is the `IGCStrategy` interface used for?
   - The `IGCStrategy` interface defines three methods related to garbage collection: `CollectionsPerDecommit`, `CanStartNoGCRegion()`, and `GetForcedGCParams()`. It is likely used to provide a strategy for garbage collection within the project.

3. What do the `GcLevel` and `GcCompaction` enums represent?
   - The `GcLevel` enum represents different generations of garbage collection, with `-1` representing no garbage collection and `0`, `1`, and `2` representing generations 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The `GcCompaction` enum represents whether or not garbage compaction should be performed during garbage collection, with `No`, `Yes`, and `Full` as the possible values.
