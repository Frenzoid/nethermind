The `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class is a part of the Nethermind project and implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. It is used to determine the best peer to synchronize with in the context of a merge between Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. 

The class has four private fields: `_preMergeBetterPeerStrategy`, `_poSSwitcher`, `_beaconPivot`, and `_logger`. The `_preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` field is an instance of the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface and is used to compare peers before the merge. The `_poSSwitcher` field is an instance of the `IPoSSwitcher` interface and is used to switch between the Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 chains. The `_beaconPivot` field is an instance of the `IBeaconPivot` interface and is used to determine the pivot block between the Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 chains. The `_logger` field is an instance of the `ILogger` interface and is used for logging.

The class has three public methods: `Compare`, `IsBetterThanLocalChain`, and `IsDesiredPeer`. The `Compare` method compares two peers based on their total difficulty and number. If the total difficulty of either peer is lower than the terminal total difficulty, the `_preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` is used to compare the peers. Otherwise, the peers are compared based on their number. The `IsBetterThanLocalChain` method determines if a peer is better than the local chain based on their total difficulty and number. If the total difficulty of the best peer is lower than the terminal total difficulty, the `_preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` is used to compare the peers. Otherwise, the best peer is considered better than the local chain if its number is greater than the local chain's number. The `IsDesiredPeer` method determines if a peer is a desired peer based on their total difficulty and number. If the beacon pivot exists, the peer is considered desired if its number is greater than or equal to the pivot number minus one. Otherwise, if the total difficulty of either the best peer or the best header is lower than the terminal total difficulty, the `_preMergeBetterPeerStrategy` is used to determine if the peer is desired.

Overall, the `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` class is an important part of the Nethermind project's synchronization process for the merge between Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. It provides a strategy for selecting the best peer to synchronize with based on their total difficulty and number, and takes into account the terminal total difficulty and the beacon pivot.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains a class called `MergeBetterPeerStrategy` which implements the `IBetterPeerStrategy` interface. It provides logic for comparing and selecting better peers during synchronization in the Nethermind project.

2. What other classes or interfaces does this code file depend on?
    
    This code file depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind` namespace, including `IBetterPeerStrategy`, `IPoSSwitcher`, `IBeaconPivot`, `ILogManager`, `UInt256`, and `ILogger`. It also depends on a class from the `Nethermind.Merge.Plugin.Synchronization` namespace.

3. What is the purpose of the `ShouldApplyPreMergeLogic` method?
    
    The `ShouldApplyPreMergeLogic` method is a private helper method that determines whether pre-merge logic should be applied during peer selection. It takes two `UInt256` values representing the total difficulty of two peers and returns a boolean indicating whether either of them is lower than the terminal total difficulty. If so, pre-merge logic should be applied.
