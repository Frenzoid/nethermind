The `MevBundleTests` class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the `MevBundle` class. The `MevBundle` class is a data class that represents a bundle of transactions that can be included in a block. The purpose of this test class is to ensure that the `MevBundle` class correctly identifies bundles based on their block number and transactions.

The `BundleTests` property is an IEnumerable that returns a collection of test cases. Each test case is a `TestCaseData` object that contains two `MevBundle` objects and an expected result. The `bundles_are_identified_by_block_number_and_transactions` method is a test method that takes two `MevBundle` objects as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two bundles are equal. This method is called for each test case in the `BundleTests` property.

The `bundles_are_sequenced` method is another test method that tests the sequencing of `MevBundle` objects. It creates two `MevBundle` objects with the same block number and an empty list of transactions. It then checks that the sequence number of the second bundle is equal to the sequence number of the first bundle plus one.

The `BuildTransaction` method is a helper method that creates a `BundleTransaction` object with a given sender private key and a flag indicating whether the transaction can be reverted. The `BundleTransaction` class is a data class that represents a transaction that can be included in a `MevBundle`. The `BuildTransaction` method is used to create test transactions for the `MevBundle` objects used in the test cases.

Overall, this test class ensures that the `MevBundle` class correctly identifies bundles based on their block number and transactions, and that `MevBundle` objects are correctly sequenced. This is important functionality for the larger project because it ensures that transactions are correctly bundled and ordered before being included in a block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MevBundle` class and how is it used in this file?
- The `MevBundle` class is used to group together a set of `BundleTransaction` objects and associate them with a block number and sequence number. It is used in this file to test the equality of different `MevBundle` instances based on their block number and transactions.

2. What is the significance of the `CanRevert` property of a `BundleTransaction` object?
- The `CanRevert` property is a boolean value that determines whether a transaction can be reverted. It is set to `false` by default but can be set to `true` when constructing a `BundleTransaction` object using the `BuildTransaction` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `bundles_are_sequenced` test method?
- The `bundles_are_sequenced` test method checks that the `SequenceNumber` property of a `MevBundle` instance is incremented by 1 when a new `MevBundle` instance is created with the same block number. This ensures that `MevBundle` instances are sequenced correctly.
