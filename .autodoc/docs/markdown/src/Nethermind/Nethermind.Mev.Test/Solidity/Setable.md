The `Setable` contract is a simple smart contract that allows for setting and getting a hash value. The purpose of this contract is to provide a way to store and retrieve a hash value that can be updated over time. 

The contract has a single state variable `hash` of type `bytes32` that stores the current hash value. The constructor initializes the `hash` variable with the hash of the integer value 0. 

The `set` function takes an input parameter `_number` of type `uint256` and updates the `hash` variable by computing the hash of the concatenation of `_number` and the current `hash` value. This ensures that the hash value is updated with each call to the `set` function. 

The `get` function simply returns the current value of the `hash` variable. 

This contract can be used in various ways in the larger project. For example, it can be used to store a hash value that represents the current state of a particular data structure or system. This hash value can then be used to verify the integrity of the data or system at a later time. 

Here is an example of how this contract can be used:

```
Setable mySetable = new Setable();
mySetable.set(123);
bytes32 currentHash = mySetable.get();
```

In this example, a new instance of the `Setable` contract is created and the `set` function is called with an input value of 123. The `get` function is then called to retrieve the current hash value, which is stored in the `currentHash` variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Setable` contract?
   - The `Setable` contract is used to store a hash value that can be updated using the `set` function and retrieved using the `get` function.

2. What is the significance of the `keccak256` function?
   - The `keccak256` function is used to generate a hash value from the input data. It is commonly used in Ethereum smart contracts for data integrity and security purposes.

3. What is the meaning of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the GPL-3.0 license.
