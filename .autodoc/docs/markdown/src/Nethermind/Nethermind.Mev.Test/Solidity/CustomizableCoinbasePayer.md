The `CustomizableCoinbasePayer` contract is a smart contract written in Solidity that allows for the customization of the payment made to the miner who mines the block containing a transaction. 

The `coinbasePayment` variable is an unsigned integer that represents the amount of ether to be paid to the miner. The default value is set to 100,000,000 wei (0.1 ether) in the constructor. 

The `deposit` function is a payable function that allows for the contract to receive ether. This function is not used to pay the miner, but rather to add funds to the contract that can be used to pay the miner later. 

The `changeCoinbasePayment` function allows for the customization of the payment made to the miner. It takes in a new `uint256` value as a parameter and sets the `coinbasePayment` variable to that value. 

The `payCoinbase` function is the function that actually pays the miner. It uses the `transfer` function to send the `coinbasePayment` amount of ether to the address of the miner who mined the block containing the transaction. The `block.coinbase` variable is a global variable that represents the address of the miner who mined the block. 

This contract can be used in the larger project as a way to incentivize miners to include transactions in their blocks. By allowing for the customization of the payment made to the miner, the contract can adjust to changes in the network and ensure that miners are adequately compensated for their work. 

Example usage:

```
CustomizableCoinbasePayer contract = new CustomizableCoinbasePayer();
contract.changeCoinbasePayment(200_000_000); // change payment to 0.2 ether
contract.payCoinbase(); // pays the miner 0.2 ether
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this contract?
   This contract is a customizable coinbase payer, which allows for the payment of a specified amount of ether to the coinbase address.

2. What is the significance of the `block.coinbase` variable?
   `block.coinbase` is a global variable in Solidity that represents the address of the miner who mined the current block. In this contract, it is used to transfer ether to the coinbase address.

3. Why is the `coinbasePayment` variable initialized in the constructor?
   The `coinbasePayment` variable is initialized in the constructor to set a default value for the amount of ether to be paid to the coinbase address.
