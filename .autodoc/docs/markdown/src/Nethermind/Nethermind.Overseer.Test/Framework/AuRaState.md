The `AuRaState` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Overseer.Test.Framework` namespace. This class implements the `ITestState` interface and provides a state object for testing the `AuRa` consensus algorithm.

The `AuRa` consensus algorithm is a modified version of the `Proof of Authority` (PoA) consensus algorithm that is used in Ethereum-based blockchain networks. It is designed to provide a more efficient and secure consensus mechanism for private and consortium blockchain networks.

The `AuRaState` class provides a state object that can be used to test the `AuRa` consensus algorithm. It contains two properties: `Blocks` and `BlocksCount`.

The `Blocks` property is a dictionary that maps block numbers to a tuple of `(string Author, long Step)`. The `Author` property represents the author of the block, while the `Step` property represents the step in the consensus algorithm that was used to create the block. The dictionary is implemented using a `SortedDictionary` to ensure that the blocks are stored in ascending order.

The `BlocksCount` property represents the total number of blocks that have been added to the `Blocks` dictionary.

This class can be used in the larger `Nethermind` project to test the `AuRa` consensus algorithm. Developers can create an instance of the `AuRaState` class and use it to simulate the creation of blocks in the `AuRa` consensus algorithm. They can then use the `Blocks` dictionary to verify that the blocks were created correctly and that the consensus algorithm is functioning as expected.

Example usage:

```
AuRaState state = new AuRaState();
state.Blocks.Add(1, ("Author1", 1));
state.Blocks.Add(2, ("Author2", 2));
state.BlocksCount = 2;

// Verify that the blocks were added correctly
Assert.AreEqual(state.Blocks[1], ("Author1", 1));
Assert.AreEqual(state.Blocks[2], ("Author2", 2));
Assert.AreEqual(state.BlocksCount, 2);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   This code file defines a class called `AuRaState` which implements the `ITestState` interface and contains two properties related to blocks.

2. What is the significance of the `IDictionary<long, (string Author, long Step)>` type for the `Blocks` property?
   The `Blocks` property is a dictionary where the keys are of type `long` and the values are tuples containing a `string` and a `long`. The `string` represents the author of a block and the `long` represents the step of the block.

3. What is the relationship between this code file and the `Nethermind.Overseer.Test.Framework` namespace?
   This code file is part of the `Nethermind.Overseer.Test.Framework` namespace and defines a class within that namespace called `AuRaState` which is used for testing purposes.
