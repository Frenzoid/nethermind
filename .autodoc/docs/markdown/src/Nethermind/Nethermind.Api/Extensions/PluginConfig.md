The `PluginConfig` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Nethermind.Api.Extensions` namespace. This class implements the `IPluginConfig` interface and provides a default implementation for the `PluginOrder` property.

The `PluginOrder` property is an array of strings that represents the order in which plugins should be loaded. The default order is defined as follows: "Clique", "Aura", "Ethash", "AuRaMerge", "Merge", "MEV", "HealthChecks", "Hive". This order can be modified by setting the `PluginOrder` property to a different array of strings.

This class is used to configure the order in which plugins are loaded by the `Nethermind` application. By default, the `PluginOrder` property is set to a specific order that is deemed optimal by the developers. However, if a user wants to change the order in which plugins are loaded, they can modify the `PluginOrder` property to suit their needs.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
var pluginConfig = new PluginConfig();
pluginConfig.PluginOrder = new string[] { "Ethash", "Clique", "Aura", "HealthChecks" };
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `PluginConfig` class and set the `PluginOrder` property to a new array of strings. This will change the order in which plugins are loaded by the `Nethermind` application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `PluginConfig` that implements the `IPluginConfig` interface and sets a default order for plugins.

2. What is the `IPluginConfig` interface and what methods/properties does it require?
   The code does not provide information on the `IPluginConfig` interface or its requirements. A smart developer might need to look for the interface definition elsewhere in the project.

3. Can the order of plugins be customized by the user?
   The code allows for the `PluginOrder` property to be set, but it is unclear if this can be done by the user or if it is only set internally. A smart developer might need to investigate further to determine if this property is configurable by the user.
