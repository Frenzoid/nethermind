The `PluginLoader` class is responsible for loading and ordering plugins for the Nethermind project. It implements the `IPluginLoader` interface and has two main methods: `Load` and `OrderPlugins`. 

The `Load` method loads plugins from two sources: embedded plugins and external plugin assemblies. Embedded plugins are passed as a parameter to the constructor, while external plugin assemblies are loaded from a specified directory. The method first loads all embedded plugins and then loads all plugin assemblies from the specified directory. For each assembly, it loads all exported types and checks if they implement the `INethermindPlugin` interface. If they do, the type is added to the `_pluginTypes` list. 

The `OrderPlugins` method orders the plugins based on a specified plugin order. It takes an `IPluginConfig` object as a parameter, which contains a list of plugin names in the desired order. The method first creates a list of plugin names with "plugin" appended to each name, then sorts the `_pluginTypes` list based on the following criteria: 

- Consensus plugins are always at the front of the list.
- Plugins in the specified order are ordered according to their position in the list.
- Plugins not in the specified order are ordered alphabetically by name.

Overall, the `PluginLoader` class provides a flexible way to load and order plugins for the Nethermind project. It can be used to load plugins from both embedded resources and external assemblies, and to order them based on a specified order. Here is an example of how to use the `PluginLoader` class:

```csharp
// Create a new PluginLoader instance
var pluginLoader = new PluginLoader("plugins", new FileSystem());

// Load plugins
pluginLoader.Load(logManager);

// Order plugins
pluginLoader.OrderPlugins(pluginConfig);

// Get the ordered list of plugin types
var pluginTypes = pluginLoader.PluginTypes;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `PluginLoader` class that loads plugins from a specified directory and embedded types, and orders them based on a given configuration.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `System`, `System.Collections.Generic`, `System.IO`, `System.IO.Abstractions`, `System.Linq`, `System.Reflection`, `System.Runtime.Loader`, `Nethermind.Logging`, and `Nethermind.Api.Extensions` namespaces.

3. What is the expected format of the plugin assemblies that this code loads?
- The plugin assemblies should be located in a specified directory and have a `.dll` file extension.
