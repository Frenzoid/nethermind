The code defines two classes, `MethodStats` and `IJsonRpcLocalStats`, that are used to track statistics related to JSON-RPC method calls in the Nethermind project. 

The `MethodStats` class contains properties that track the number of successful and failed method calls (`Successes` and `Errors`, respectively), the average time taken for successful and failed calls (`AvgTimeOfSuccesses` and `AvgTimeOfErrors`, respectively), the maximum time taken for a successful and failed call (`MaxTimeOfSuccess` and `MaxTimeOfError`, respectively), the total size of all calls (`TotalSize`), and the average size of a call (`AvgSize`). The `Calls` property is a calculated property that returns the total number of calls (successful and failed) made for a given method.

The `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface defines two methods. The `ReportCall` method is used to report statistics for a single method call. It takes in a `RpcReport` object that contains information about the method call, as well as optional parameters for the elapsed time and size of the call. The `GetMethodStats` method is used to retrieve the statistics for a specific method. It takes in the name of the method as a parameter and returns a `MethodStats` object containing the statistics for that method.

Overall, these classes and interface are used to provide insight into the performance and usage of JSON-RPC methods in the Nethermind project. Developers can use this information to identify areas for optimization and improvement. For example, if a particular method has a high error rate or long average time, developers may investigate ways to optimize that method's implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class `MethodStats` and an interface `IJsonRpcLocalStats` for reporting and retrieving statistics related to JSON-RPC method calls.

2. What properties and methods are available in the `MethodStats` class?
   - The `MethodStats` class has properties for tracking the number of successes and errors, average time and size of successes and errors, maximum time of success and error, total size, and total number of calls. It also has an auto-implemented property for calculating the average size.

3. What is the purpose of the `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface?
   - The `IJsonRpcLocalStats` interface defines two methods: `ReportCall` for reporting statistics related to a JSON-RPC method call, and `GetMethodStats` for retrieving statistics related to a specific method. Classes implementing this interface can use these methods to track and report statistics for JSON-RPC method calls.
