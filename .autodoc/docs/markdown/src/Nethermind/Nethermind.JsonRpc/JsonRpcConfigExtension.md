The code provided is a C# class called `JsonRpcConfigExtension` that contains a single static method called `EnableModules`. This method takes an instance of an interface called `IJsonRpcConfig` and a variable number of string parameters representing the names of modules to enable. 

The purpose of this method is to allow for the enabling of specific modules within the larger Nethermind project's JSON-RPC configuration. The `IJsonRpcConfig` interface is likely implemented by a class that contains various configuration options for the JSON-RPC server. The `EnableModules` method takes the current set of enabled modules, adds the new modules passed in as parameters, and then sets the updated list of enabled modules back to the `IJsonRpcConfig` instance.

Here is an example of how this method might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```
// Create an instance of the JSON-RPC configuration class
var config = new MyJsonRpcConfig();

// Enable the "eth" and "net" modules
config.EnableModules("eth", "net");

// Start the JSON-RPC server with the updated configuration
var server = new JsonRpcServer(config);
server.Start();
```

In this example, the `EnableModules` method is used to enable the "eth" and "net" modules within the JSON-RPC configuration. These modules may provide additional functionality to the JSON-RPC server, such as the ability to interact with the Ethereum network or retrieve network information.

Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to enable specific modules within the Nethermind JSON-RPC configuration, allowing for greater customization and functionality within the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines an extension method for the `IJsonRpcConfig` interface that allows modules to be enabled.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
   The SPDX-License-Identifier comment specifies the license under which the code is released and is used to ensure license compliance.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToHashSet()` method?
   The `ToHashSet()` method is used to convert the `EnabledModules` property of the `IJsonRpcConfig` interface to a `HashSet<string>` to enable efficient set operations.
