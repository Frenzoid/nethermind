The code is a C# implementation of an RPC module for the Nethermind project. The purpose of this module is to replicate the functionality of a similar module in the Ethereum Go client, specifically the `rpc_modules` method. This method returns a dictionary of enabled RPC modules and their corresponding versions.

The `RpcRpcModule` class implements the `IRpcRpcModule` interface, which defines the `rpc_modules` method. The constructor takes a collection of enabled module names as an argument and initializes a dictionary `_enabledModules` with the module names as keys and a fixed version number of "1.0" as values. This is done to mimic the behavior of the Ethereum Go client, which also uses a fixed version number.

The `rpc_modules` method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing the `_enabledModules` dictionary as a successful result. This method can be called by an RPC client to retrieve a list of enabled modules and their versions.

This module is important for the Nethermind project as it provides compatibility with the `geth attach` command, which allows an external process to attach to a running Ethereum node and interact with it via RPC calls. By implementing this module, Nethermind can provide a similar interface to the Ethereum Go client, making it easier for developers to switch between the two clients.

Example usage:

```
var enabledModules = new List<string> { "eth", "net", "web3" };
var rpcModule = new RpcRpcModule(enabledModules);
var result = rpcModule.rpc_modules();
Console.WriteLine(result.Value["eth"]); // prints "1.0"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a C# implementation of a JSON-RPC module for the Nethermind project, specifically replicating a feature from the Ethereum Go client to ensure compatibility with `geth attach`.

2. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier and SPDX-FileCopyrightText comments?
   - These comments indicate the license under which the code is released and provide attribution to the copyright holder.

3. What is the purpose of the `rpc_modules` method and what does it return?
   - The `rpc_modules` method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing a dictionary of enabled modules and their corresponding versions. Its purpose is likely to provide information about the available modules to clients using the JSON-RPC interface.
