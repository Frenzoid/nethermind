The `TxPoolInspection` class in the `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.TxPool` namespace is responsible for providing a summary of the transactions in the transaction pool. It takes an instance of `TxPoolInfo` as input and generates two dictionaries: `Pending` and `Queued`. 

The `Pending` dictionary contains all the pending transactions in the transaction pool, where the key is the sender's address and the value is another dictionary. The inner dictionary contains the nonce of the transaction as the key and a string as the value. The string is generated by calling the `GetTransactionSummary` method, which returns a summary of the transaction in the format of "sender address: value wei + gas limit x gas price gas". 

The `Queued` dictionary contains all the queued transactions in the transaction pool, where the key is the sender's address and the value is another dictionary. The inner dictionary contains the nonce of the transaction as the key and a string as the value. The string is generated in the same way as for the `Pending` dictionary.

This class can be used to provide a summary of the transactions in the transaction pool to the user or other parts of the system. For example, it can be used by a JSON-RPC module to provide information about the transactions in the transaction pool to a client. 

Here is an example of how to use this class:

```
TxPoolInfo txPoolInfo = GetTxPoolInfo(); // get the transaction pool info
TxPoolInspection txPoolInspection = new TxPoolInspection(txPoolInfo); // create an instance of TxPoolInspection
IDictionary<Address, Dictionary<ulong, string>> pending = txPoolInspection.Pending; // get the pending transactions
IDictionary<Address, Dictionary<ulong, string>> queued = txPoolInspection.Queued; // get the queued transactions
```

In this example, `GetTxPoolInfo` is a method that returns an instance of `TxPoolInfo`. The `Pending` and `Queued` dictionaries can then be used to provide a summary of the transactions in the transaction pool to the user or other parts of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `TxPoolInspection` that takes in a `TxPoolInfo` object and creates dictionaries of pending and queued transactions with their summaries.

2. What is the `TxPoolInfo` object and where does it come from?
   - The `TxPoolInfo` object is not defined in this code and must be imported from another module or library. It likely contains information about the current state of the transaction pool.

3. What is the format of the transaction summary string?
   - The transaction summary string is formatted as "{sender address}: {value} wei + {gas limit} x {gas price} gas". It provides a brief overview of the transaction's key details.
