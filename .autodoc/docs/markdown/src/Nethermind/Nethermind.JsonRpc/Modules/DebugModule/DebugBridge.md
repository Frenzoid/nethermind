The `DebugBridge` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides debugging functionality for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is used to interact with the blockchain data and provide debugging information to the user. 

The class has several dependencies that are injected through its constructor, including `IConfigProvider`, `IReadOnlyDbProvider`, `IGethStyleTracer`, `IBlockTree`, `IReceiptStorage`, `IReceiptsMigration`, `ISpecProvider`, and `ISyncModeSelector`. These dependencies are used to access the blockchain data, trace transactions, and provide synchronization information.

The `DebugBridge` class provides several methods that can be used to interact with the blockchain data. The `GetDbValue` method retrieves a value from the specified database by key. The `GetLevelInfo` method retrieves information about a specific block level. The `DeleteChainSlice` method deletes a chain slice starting from the specified block number. The `UpdateHeadBlock` method updates the head block of the blockchain.

The `MigrateReceipts` method migrates receipts for a specific block number. The `InsertReceipts` method inserts transaction receipts for a specific block. The `GetTransactionTrace` method retrieves a trace of a specific transaction. The `GetBlockTrace` method retrieves a trace of a specific block. The `GetBlockRlp` method retrieves the RLP-encoded block data for a specific block.

The `GetConfigValue` method retrieves a configuration value for a specific category and name. The `GetCurrentSyncStage` method retrieves the current synchronization stage of the blockchain.

Overall, the `DebugBridge` class provides a set of debugging tools that can be used to interact with the blockchain data and provide debugging information to the user. It is an important module in the Nethermind project that helps developers debug their smart contracts and applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DebugBridge` class?
- The `DebugBridge` class is a module in the `JsonRpc` namespace that provides debugging functionality for the Nethermind blockchain node.

2. What databases are being used in this code and how are they mapped?
- The code uses several databases including `StateDb`, `BlockInfosDb`, `BlocksDb`, `HeadersDb`, `MetadataDb`, `CodeDb`, and `ReceiptsDb`. These databases are mapped to their respective names using a dictionary called `_dbMappings`.

3. What is the purpose of the `MigrateReceipts` method?
- The `MigrateReceipts` method is used to migrate receipts for a given block number. It takes the block number as input, adds 1 to it to make it exclusive, and then runs the `_receiptsMigration` object's `Run` method with the updated block number.
