The code above defines a class called `MemStats` within the `DebugModule` namespace of the `Nethermind` project. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to retrieve information about the total memory usage of the system. 

The `MemStats` class has a single property called `TotalMemory`, which is a `long` type. This property is used to store the total amount of memory used by the system. 

This class can be used in conjunction with other classes and modules within the `Nethermind` project to provide debugging and monitoring capabilities. For example, a developer may use this class to retrieve information about the memory usage of a specific process or module within the system. 

Here is an example of how this class may be used in code:

```
using Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.DebugModule;

// ...

MemStats memStats = new MemStats();
long totalMemory = memStats.TotalMemory;
Console.WriteLine($"Total memory used: {totalMemory} bytes");
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `MemStats` class and retrieve the value of the `TotalMemory` property. We then print out the total memory usage in bytes to the console. 

Overall, the `MemStats` class provides a simple and straightforward way to retrieve information about the memory usage of the system, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.
