This code defines an enumeration called `RpcEndpoint` that is used to represent the different types of endpoints that can be used to communicate with a JSON-RPC server. The `RpcEndpoint` enumeration is marked with the `[Flags]` attribute, which allows its values to be combined using bitwise OR operations.

The `RpcEndpoint` enumeration has five possible values:

- `None`: Represents no endpoint.
- `Http`: Represents an HTTP endpoint.
- `Ws`: Represents a WebSocket endpoint.
- `IPC`: Represents an IPC endpoint.
- `All`: Represents all available endpoints.

The `Http` and `Https` values are equivalent, as are the `Ws` and `Wss` values. The `All` value is a combination of the `Http`, `Ws`, and `IPC` values.

This enumeration is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project to specify which endpoints should be used for JSON-RPC communication. For example, a configuration file might include a setting that specifies which endpoints should be enabled, and this setting would be represented using the `RpcEndpoint` enumeration.

Here is an example of how the `RpcEndpoint` enumeration might be used in code:

```csharp
using Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules;

// ...

RpcEndpoint enabledEndpoints = RpcEndpoint.Http | RpcEndpoint.Ws;

if ((enabledEndpoints & RpcEndpoint.Http) != 0)
{
    // HTTP endpoint is enabled
}

if ((enabledEndpoints & RpcEndpoint.Ws) != 0)
{
    // WebSocket endpoint is enabled
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this code is for and what it does. This code defines an enum called `RpcEndpoint` that represents the different types of endpoints that can be used for JSON-RPC communication in the Nethermind project.

2. **What do the different values of the `RpcEndpoint` enum represent?**\
A smart developer might want to know what each value of the `RpcEndpoint` enum represents. The `None` value represents no endpoint, `Http` represents an HTTP endpoint, `Ws` represents a WebSocket endpoint, `IPC` represents an inter-process communication endpoint, `Https` is an alias for `Http`, `Wss` is an alias for `Ws`, and `All` represents all available endpoints.

3. **Why is the `RpcEndpoint` enum marked with the `[Flags]` attribute?**\
A smart developer might question why the `RpcEndpoint` enum is marked with the `[Flags]` attribute. This attribute indicates that the enum values can be combined using bitwise OR operations, allowing for more flexible endpoint configurations.
