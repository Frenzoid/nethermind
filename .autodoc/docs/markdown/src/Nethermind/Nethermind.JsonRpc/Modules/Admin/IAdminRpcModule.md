This code defines an interface for an Admin JSON-RPC module in the Nethermind project. The module provides several methods for managing and retrieving information about the Ethereum network. 

The `admin_addPeer` method adds a new node to the network. It takes a string parameter `enode` which represents the node to be added. An optional boolean parameter `addToStaticNodes` can be set to true to add the node to the static nodes list. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing a string representing the added node.

The `admin_removePeer` method removes a node from the network. It takes a string parameter `enode` which represents the node to be removed. An optional boolean parameter `removeFromStaticNodes` can be set to true to remove the node from the static nodes list. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing a string representing the removed node.

The `admin_peers` method returns a list of connected peers and their information. An optional boolean parameter `includeDetails` can be set to true to include additional details such as client type, Ethereum protocol version, and last signal time. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing an array of `PeerInfo` objects.

The `admin_nodeInfo` method returns information about the current node, such as its ID, IP address, and Ethereum protocol details. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing a `NodeInfo` object.

The `admin_dataDir` method returns the base data directory path. This method is not implemented.

The `admin_setSolc` method is deprecated and not implemented.

The `admin_prune` method runs a full pruning of the blockchain if enabled. The method returns a `ResultWrapper` object containing a `PruningStatus` object.

Overall, this interface provides a set of methods for managing and retrieving information about the Ethereum network. These methods can be used by other modules in the Nethermind project to interact with the network and perform administrative tasks. For example, the `admin_peers` method can be used by a monitoring module to display a list of connected peers and their details.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines an interface for an Admin JSON-RPC module in the Nethermind blockchain project.

2. What methods are available in the Admin module and what do they do?
- The Admin module has methods for adding and removing peers, displaying a list of connected peers, displaying information about the node, getting the data directory path, setting the Solidity compiler (deprecated), and running full pruning if enabled.

3. What is the expected format of the input and output parameters for the methods in this module?
- The input and output parameters for each method are described in the method's attributes, such as the JsonRpcMethod and JsonRpcParameter attributes. The expected format of the input and output parameters varies depending on the method.
