The `PeerInfo` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides information about a peer in the Ethereum network. It contains properties that describe various attributes of a peer, such as its client ID, host, port, address, and whether it is a bootnode, trusted, or static. Additionally, it provides information about the peer's client type, Ethereum details, and last signal.

The `PeerInfo` class has two constructors. The first constructor is empty and does not take any arguments. The second constructor takes a `Peer` object and a boolean value `includeDetails`. The `Peer` object contains information about the peer, such as its node, in-session, and out-session. The `includeDetails` parameter is used to determine whether to include additional details about the peer, such as its client type, Ethereum details, and last signal.

The `PeerInfo` class is used in the Nethermind project to provide information about peers in the Ethereum network. For example, it can be used to display information about peers in a user interface or to log information about peers for debugging purposes. 

Here is an example of how the `PeerInfo` class can be used to create a list of peers with their information:

```
using Nethermind.Network;
using Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Admin;

List<Peer> peers = GetPeersFromNetwork();
List<PeerInfo> peerInfos = new List<PeerInfo>();

foreach (Peer peer in peers)
{
    PeerInfo peerInfo = new PeerInfo(peer, true);
    peerInfos.Add(peerInfo);
}

DisplayPeerInfo(peerInfos);
```

In this example, the `GetPeersFromNetwork` method retrieves a list of peers from the Ethereum network. The `PeerInfo` class is then used to create a list of `PeerInfo` objects with additional details. Finally, the `DisplayPeerInfo` method is called to display the peer information in a user interface.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a `PeerInfo` class in the `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Admin` namespace that represents information about a peer in the Nethermind network.

2. What is the `Peer` class and where is it defined?
    
    The `Peer` class is used in the constructor of the `PeerInfo` class to extract information about a peer. It is not defined in this file, so a smart developer might want to look for its definition elsewhere in the project.

3. What is the significance of the `includeDetails` parameter in the `PeerInfo` constructor?
    
    The `includeDetails` parameter determines whether additional details about the peer should be included in the `PeerInfo` object. If `includeDetails` is `true`, the `ClientType`, `EthDetails`, and `LastSignal` properties will be populated with information about the peer's client type, Ethereum details, and last ping time, respectively.
