[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.JsonRpc/Modules/Admin/PortsInfo.cs)

This code defines a C# class called `PortsInfo` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's `JsonRpc` module's `Admin` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide a data structure for storing information about the ports used by the `Nethermind` client.

The `PortsInfo` class has two properties: `Discovery` and `Listener`. These properties are decorated with the `JsonProperty` attribute from the `Newtonsoft.Json` namespace, which is used to specify the names of the properties when they are serialized to JSON. The `Order` property of the `JsonProperty` attribute is used to specify the order in which the properties should appear in the serialized JSON.

The `Discovery` property represents the port used for peer discovery, while the `Listener` property represents the port used for incoming connections. These ports are important for the `Nethermind` client to function properly, as they allow the client to communicate with other nodes on the network.

This class can be used in various parts of the `Nethermind` project's `JsonRpc` module's `Admin` namespace to provide information about the ports used by the `Nethermind` client. For example, it could be used in a JSON-RPC method that returns information about the client's configuration, including the ports used for peer discovery and incoming connections.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a JSON-RPC method:

```csharp
[JsonRpcMethod("admin_getPortsInfo")]
public PortsInfo GetPortsInfo()
{
    PortsInfo portsInfo = new PortsInfo();
    portsInfo.Discovery = 30303;
    portsInfo.Listener = 30304;
    return portsInfo;
}
```

In this example, the `GetPortsInfo` method returns a `PortsInfo` object with the `Discovery` property set to `30303` and the `Listener` property set to `30304`. This method could be called by a client to retrieve information about the ports used by the `Nethermind` client.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a C# class called `PortsInfo` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's JSON-RPC module for administrative tasks. It has two properties, `Discovery` and `Listener`, both of which are integers and are decorated with `JsonProperty` attributes.

2. What is the significance of the `JsonProperty` attribute?
   The `JsonProperty` attribute is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to a given C# property. In this case, the `Discovery` property is mapped to a JSON property called "discovery" and the `Listener` property is mapped to a JSON property called "listener".

3. What is the license for this code?
   The code is licensed under the LGPL-3.0-only license, as indicated by the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment at the top of the file. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code as long as they comply with the terms of the license.
