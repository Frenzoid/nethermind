The `ParityTxTraceFromStore` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides functionality for converting transaction traces in the Parity format to a more readable and usable format. The class contains two static methods, `FromTxTrace`, which take in a `ParityLikeTxTrace` object or a collection of `ParityLikeTxTrace` objects and return an `IEnumerable` of `ParityTxTraceFromStore` objects.

The `ReturnActionsRecursively` method is a private helper method that recursively converts the `ParityLikeTxTrace` object to a `ParityTxTraceFromStore` object. It checks if the `txTraceAction` is null or not included in the trace and returns an empty `IEnumerable` if it is. Otherwise, it creates a new `ParityTxTraceFromStore` object with the relevant properties from the `txTrace` object and adds it to the result. It then iterates through the subtraces of the `txTraceAction` and recursively calls the `ReturnActionsRecursively` method on each subtrace, adding the resulting `ParityTxTraceFromStore` objects to the result.

The `ParityTxTraceFromStore` class contains properties that correspond to the relevant fields in the `ParityLikeTxTrace` object, such as `Action`, `BlockHash`, `BlockNumber`, `Result`, `Subtraces`, `TraceAddress`, `TransactionHash`, `TransactionPosition`, `Type`, and `Error`. These properties are set by the `ReturnActionsRecursively` method and can be accessed by the caller.

Overall, the `ParityTxTraceFromStore` class provides a useful module for converting Parity transaction traces to a more readable and usable format, which can be used in various parts of the Nethermind project. For example, it could be used in debugging and analysis tools to help developers better understand the behavior of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ParityTxTraceFromStore` class?
    
    The `ParityTxTraceFromStore` class is used to convert a `ParityLikeTxTrace` object or a collection of `ParityLikeTxTrace` objects into a collection of `ParityTxTraceFromStore` objects.

2. What is the significance of the `IncludeInTrace` property of `ParityTraceAction`?
    
    The `IncludeInTrace` property of `ParityTraceAction` is used to determine whether or not the action should be included in the trace. If it is set to `false`, the action will not be included.

3. What is the purpose of the `LongConverter` class?
    
    The `LongConverter` class is used to convert a `long` value to a JSON string using raw number conversion. This is used to serialize the `BlockNumber` property of `ParityTxTraceFromStore`.
