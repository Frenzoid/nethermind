The code defines a class called `FeeHistoryResults` that is used in the `Nethermind` project's `JsonRpc` module for Ethereum. The purpose of this class is to represent the results of a fee history query on the Ethereum network. 

The `FeeHistoryResults` class has four properties: `BaseFeePerGas`, `GasUsedRatio`, `OldestBlock`, and `Reward`. `BaseFeePerGas` is an array of `UInt256` values representing the base fee per gas for each block in the fee history. `GasUsedRatio` is an array of `double` values representing the ratio of gas used to gas limit for each block in the fee history. `OldestBlock` is a `long` value representing the block number of the oldest block in the fee history. `Reward` is a two-dimensional array of `UInt256` values representing the reward for each miner for each block in the fee history.

The `FeeHistoryResults` class has a constructor that takes in the `oldestBlock`, `baseFeePerGas`, `gasUsedRatio`, and `reward` parameters. The `oldestBlock` parameter is used to set the `OldestBlock` property. The `baseFeePerGas` parameter is used to set the `BaseFeePerGas` property. The `gasUsedRatio` parameter is used to set the `GasUsedRatio` property. The `reward` parameter is an optional parameter that is used to set the `Reward` property.

This class can be used in the `JsonRpc` module to return the results of a fee history query to the user. For example, the following code snippet shows how the `FeeHistoryResults` class can be used to return the fee history results to the user:

```
FeeHistoryResults feeHistoryResults = new FeeHistoryResults(1000000, new UInt256[] { 100, 200, 300 }, new double[] { 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 }, new UInt256[][] { new UInt256[] { 1000, 2000, 3000 }, new UInt256[] { 4000, 5000, 6000 } });
return feeHistoryResults;
```

In this example, the `FeeHistoryResults` object is created with the `oldestBlock` parameter set to `1000000`, the `baseFeePerGas` parameter set to an array of `UInt256` values `{ 100, 200, 300 }`, the `gasUsedRatio` parameter set to an array of `double` values `{ 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 }`, and the `reward` parameter set to a two-dimensional array of `UInt256` values `{ { 1000, 2000, 3000 }, { 4000, 5000, 6000 } }`. The `FeeHistoryResults` object is then returned to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class called `FeeHistoryResults` that contains properties for base fee per gas, gas used ratio, oldest block, and reward. It also has a constructor that initializes these properties.
   
2. What is the significance of the `UInt256` and `double` data types used in this code?
   - `UInt256` is a custom data type defined in the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace and is likely used to represent large unsigned integers. `double` is a built-in data type in C# and is used to represent floating-point numbers with double precision.

3. What is the purpose of the `?` symbol after the `UInt256[]` and `double[]` data types?
   - The `?` symbol indicates that these properties can be null. This means that they may or may not have a value assigned to them, and the code must handle this possibility accordingly.
