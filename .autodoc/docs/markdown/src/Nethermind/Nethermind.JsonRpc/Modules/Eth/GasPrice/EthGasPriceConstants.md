[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.JsonRpc/Modules/Eth/GasPrice/EthGasPriceConstants.cs)

The code defines a static class called `EthGasPriceConstants` that contains various constants related to gas prices in the Ethereum network. These constants are used in the `Nethermind` project to determine gas prices for transactions.

The `PercentileOfSortedTxs` constant is used to determine the percentile of sorted transactions that should be used to calculate the gas price. The `DefaultBlocksLimit` and `DefaultBlocksLimitMaxPriorityFeePerGas` constants are used to limit the number of blocks that are checked for transactions to add to the sorted transaction list. The `TxLimitFromABlock` constant sets the maximum number of transactions that can be added to the sorted transaction list from a single block. The `DefaultIgnoreUnder` constant sets the minimum effective gas price that should be considered.

The `MaxGasPrice` constant sets the maximum gas price that can be returned by the `EthGasPrice` module. The `FallbackMaxPriorityFeePerGas` constant sets the maximum priority fee per gas that can be used as a fallback value.

Overall, this code provides a set of constants that are used to determine gas prices for transactions in the Ethereum network. These constants are used in various modules of the `Nethermind` project to ensure that gas prices are calculated accurately and efficiently. For example, the `MaxGasPrice` constant can be used to prevent transactions from being executed with excessively high gas prices, which can lead to network congestion and high fees.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains constants related to gas prices in the Ethereum network, specifically for the EthGasPrice module of the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxGasPrice` and `FallbackMaxPriorityFeePerGas` constants?
- `MaxGasPrice` is the maximum gas price that can be returned, set to 500 Gwei. `FallbackMaxPriorityFeePerGas` is the fallback maximum priority fee per gas, set to 200 Gwei. These constants are important for setting limits on gas prices to prevent excessive fees.

3. What is the meaning of the `PercentileOfSortedTxs` constant?
- `PercentileOfSortedTxs` is the percentile of sorted transaction list indexes to choose as gas price. It is set to 60, which means that the gas price will be chosen from the 60th percentile of the sorted transaction list. This constant is important for determining the gas price for transactions in the Ethereum network.
