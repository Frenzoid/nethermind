The `FeeHistoryOracle` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides a way to retrieve historical fee data for Ethereum transactions. This class implements the `IFeeHistoryOracle` interface, which defines the `GetFeeHistory` method that returns a `ResultWrapper<FeeHistoryResults>` object. The `FeeHistoryResults` object contains the historical fee data for a specified number of blocks.

The `GetFeeHistory` method takes in three parameters: `blockCount`, `newestBlock`, and `rewardPercentiles`. `blockCount` specifies the number of blocks to retrieve historical fee data for. `newestBlock` specifies the block number to start retrieving data from. `rewardPercentiles` is an optional parameter that specifies the percentiles to calculate for transaction rewards.

The `GetFeeHistory` method first calls the `Validate` method to validate the input parameters. If the validation fails, the method returns a `ResultWrapper` object with an error message. If the validation succeeds, the method retrieves the block with the specified block number using the `_blockFinder` object. It then iterates through the specified number of blocks, starting from the specified block number, and retrieves the historical fee data for each block.

The historical fee data for each block is stored in a `FeeHistoryResults` object, which contains four arrays: `baseFeePerGas`, `gasUsedRatio`, `rewards`, and `blockNumbers`. `baseFeePerGas` is an array of `UInt256` values that represent the base fee per gas for each block. `gasUsedRatio` is an array of `double` values that represent the gas used ratio for each block. `rewards` is an array of `UInt256` arrays that represent the transaction rewards for each block, calculated for the specified percentiles. `blockNumbers` is an array of `long` values that represent the block numbers for each block.

The `FeeHistoryOracle` class uses several other classes from the Nethermind project to retrieve the historical fee data. The `_blockFinder` object is used to retrieve blocks by block number. The `_receiptStorage` object is used to retrieve transaction receipts for each block. The `BaseFeeCalculator` class is used to calculate the base fee per gas for each block. The `ISpecProvider` interface is used to retrieve the Ethereum specification for each block.

Overall, the `FeeHistoryOracle` class provides a way to retrieve historical fee data for Ethereum transactions, which can be useful for analyzing transaction fees and optimizing gas prices.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a C# implementation of a fee history oracle module for the Nethermind Ethereum client. It provides a way to retrieve historical fee data for a specified number of blocks.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other modules within the Nethermind project, including `Nethermind.Blockchain`, `Nethermind.Core`, and `Nethermind.Int256`. It also relies on interfaces `IBlockFinder`, `IReceiptStorage`, and `ISpecProvider` which are presumably implemented elsewhere.

3. What is the significance of the `rewardPercentiles` parameter?
- The `rewardPercentiles` parameter is an optional array of doubles that specifies which percentiles of transaction fees to include in the results. For example, if `rewardPercentiles` is `[50, 90]`, the returned `FeeHistoryResults` object will include the median and 90th percentile transaction fees for each block in the specified range.
