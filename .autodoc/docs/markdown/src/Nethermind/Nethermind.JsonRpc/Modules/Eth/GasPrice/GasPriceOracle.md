The `GasPriceOracle` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides an estimate of the gas price for Ethereum transactions. The gas price is the amount of Ether that a user is willing to pay for each unit of gas consumed by a transaction. The gas price is used to incentivize miners to include a transaction in a block. The higher the gas price, the more likely a transaction will be included in a block.

The `GasPriceOracle` class implements the `IGasPriceOracle` interface, which defines two methods: `GetGasPriceEstimate` and `GetMaxPriorityGasFeeEstimate`. The `GetGasPriceEstimate` method returns an estimate of the gas price based on recent transactions in the blockchain. The `GetMaxPriorityGasFeeEstimate` method returns an estimate of the maximum priority fee per gas that a user should pay to ensure that their transaction is included in a block.

The `GasPriceOracle` class uses a `PriceCache` struct to cache the gas price estimates for recent blocks. The `PriceCache` struct stores the gas price estimate and the hash of the block for which the estimate was calculated. The `GasPriceOracle` class uses the `PriceCache` struct to avoid recalculating the gas price estimate for a block if it has already been calculated.

The `GasPriceOracle` class uses the `IBlockFinder` interface to find blocks in the blockchain. The `ISpecProvider` interface is used to determine if EIP-1559 is enabled for a block. EIP-1559 is a proposal to change the Ethereum transaction fee market to make it more efficient and predictable.

The `GasPriceOracle` class calculates the gas price estimate by analyzing recent transactions in the blockchain. The `GetGasPricesFromRecentBlocks` method retrieves recent blocks from the blockchain and extracts the gas prices from the transactions in those blocks. The `GetGasPriceAtPercentile` method calculates the gas price estimate by taking the gas price at the specified percentile of the sorted gas prices.

The `GasPriceOracle` class also provides a fallback gas price estimate if there are no recent transactions in the blockchain. The fallback gas price estimate is calculated based on the minimum gas price specified in the `BlocksConfig` class.

Overall, the `GasPriceOracle` class is an important module in the Nethermind project that provides an estimate of the gas price for Ethereum transactions. The gas price estimate is used to incentivize miners to include transactions in blocks and is an important factor in the Ethereum transaction fee market.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Gas Price Oracle module for the Nethermind Ethereum client that estimates gas prices for transactions based on recent blocks.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `Nethermind` namespace, which includes modules for the Nethermind Ethereum client, as well as the `System` namespace for basic C# functionality.

3. What is the algorithm used to calculate gas prices?
- The `GetGasPriceEstimate` method calculates gas prices by getting recent blocks from the blockchain, sorting their transactions by gas price, and returning the gas price at a certain percentile. The `GetMaxPriorityGasFeeEstimate` method calculates the maximum priority fee per gas by getting recent blocks and their transactions, and returning the maximum priority fee per gas at a certain percentile.
