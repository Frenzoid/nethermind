The code defines a class called `SyncingResultConverter` that inherits from `JsonConverter<SyncingResult>`. This class is responsible for converting `SyncingResult` objects to and from JSON format. 

The `WriteJson` method is called when a `SyncingResult` object needs to be serialized to JSON. It checks if the `IsSyncing` property of the `SyncingResult` object is `true`. If it is not, it writes `false` to the JSON output. If it is `true`, it writes an object to the JSON output with three properties: `startingBlock`, `currentBlock`, and `highestBlock`. These properties correspond to the `StartingBlock`, `CurrentBlock`, and `HighestBlock` properties of the `SyncingResult` object, respectively. 

The `ReadJson` method is called when a JSON object needs to be deserialized to a `SyncingResult` object. However, this method is not implemented and throws a `NotSupportedException`. This is because the `SyncingResult` class is not meant to be deserialized from JSON. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to handle JSON serialization and deserialization of `SyncingResult` objects. It provides a way to convert `SyncingResult` objects to and from JSON format, which is useful for communicating with other systems that use JSON as a data format. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```csharp
SyncingResult syncingResult = new SyncingResult
{
    IsSyncing = true,
    StartingBlock = 100,
    CurrentBlock = 200,
    HighestBlock = 300
};

string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(syncingResult, new SyncingResultConverter());
// json is now '{"startingBlock":100,"currentBlock":200,"highestBlock":300}'

SyncingResult deserializedResult = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SyncingResult>(json, new SyncingResultConverter());
// deserializedResult is now a SyncingResult object with IsSyncing = true, StartingBlock = 100, CurrentBlock = 200, and HighestBlock = 300
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a custom JSON converter for the `SyncingResult` class in the `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules.Eth` namespace.

2. What is the `SyncingResult` class and what properties does it have?
   - The `SyncingResult` class is not defined in this code snippet, but it likely represents the result of a synchronization process in the Ethereum network. It has at least three properties: `StartingBlock`, `CurrentBlock`, and `HighestBlock`.

3. Why does the `ReadJson` method throw a `NotSupportedException`?
   - The `ReadJson` method is not implemented because this converter is only used for serialization (writing JSON), not deserialization (reading JSON). Therefore, attempting to deserialize JSON using this converter would result in a `NotSupportedException`.
