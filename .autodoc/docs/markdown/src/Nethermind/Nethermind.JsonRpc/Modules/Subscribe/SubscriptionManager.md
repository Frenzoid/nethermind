The `SubscriptionManager` class is responsible for managing subscriptions to JSON-RPC notifications and requests. It is part of the `nethermind` project and is used to handle subscriptions for various modules, including the `Eth` module.

The class contains two dictionaries: `_subscriptions` and `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient`. The `_subscriptions` dictionary stores all active subscriptions, while the `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionary stores subscriptions grouped by the JSON-RPC client that created them.

The `AddSubscription` method is used to add a new subscription to the manager. It takes a `jsonRpcDuplexClient`, which is a JSON-RPC client that can send and receive messages, a `subscriptionType`, which is a string that identifies the type of subscription, and an optional `args` parameter that contains additional subscription parameters. The method creates a new `Subscription` object using the `_subscriptionFactory` and adds it to the `_subscriptions` and `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionaries. It then returns the ID of the new subscription.

The `RemoveSubscription` method is used to remove a subscription from the manager. It takes a `jsonRpcDuplexClient` and a `subscriptionId`. If the subscription exists and was created by the specified client, it is removed from the dictionaries and disposed of. The method returns `true` if the subscription was successfully removed, and `false` otherwise.

The `RemoveClientSubscriptions` method is used to remove all subscriptions created by a specific JSON-RPC client. It takes a `jsonRpcDuplexClient` and removes all subscriptions associated with it from the `_subscriptions` and `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionaries. The method also disposes of all removed subscriptions.

The `SubscriptionManager` class is used by other modules in the `nethermind` project to manage subscriptions to JSON-RPC notifications and requests. For example, the `Eth` module uses the `SubscriptionManager` to manage subscriptions to new block headers, logs, and pending transactions. Here is an example of how the `Eth` module might use the `SubscriptionManager` to add a new subscription:

```
ISubscriptionManager subscriptionManager = ...; // get the subscription manager
IJsonRpcDuplexClient jsonRpcDuplexClient = ...; // create a JSON-RPC client
string subscriptionId = subscriptionManager.AddSubscription(jsonRpcDuplexClient, "newHeads"); // add a new subscription for new block headers
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SubscriptionManager` class?
- The `SubscriptionManager` class is responsible for managing subscriptions to JSON-RPC notifications and returning subscription IDs.

2. What is the purpose of the `_subscriptions` and `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionaries?
- The `_subscriptions` dictionary stores all active subscriptions, while the `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionary stores all subscriptions for a given JSON-RPC client.

3. What happens when a JSON-RPC client is closed?
- When a JSON-RPC client is closed, all of its subscriptions are removed and disposed of, and the client is removed from the `_subscriptionsByJsonRpcClient` dictionary.
