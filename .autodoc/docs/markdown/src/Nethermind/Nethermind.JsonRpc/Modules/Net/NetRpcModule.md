The `NetRpcModule` class is a module in the Nethermind project that provides JSON-RPC methods related to network information. It implements the `INetRpcModule` interface, which defines the methods that should be implemented by a network module in order to expose network-related functionality over JSON-RPC.

The constructor of the `NetRpcModule` class takes an instance of `ILogManager` and an instance of `INetBridge` as parameters. The `INetBridge` instance is used to access network-related information, such as the local address, the local enode, the network ID, and the number of peers. The `ILogManager` instance is not used in this class, but it is likely used in other parts of the project for logging purposes.

The `NetRpcModule` class provides five JSON-RPC methods:

- `net_localAddress()`: Returns the local address of the node as an `Address` object wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.
- `net_localEnode()`: Returns the local enode of the node as a string wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.
- `net_version()`: Returns the network ID of the node as a string wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.
- `net_listening()`: Returns `true` wrapped in a `ResultWrapper` to indicate that the node is listening for incoming connections.
- `net_peerCount()`: Returns the number of peers connected to the node as a `long` wrapped in a `ResultWrapper`.

These methods are used to expose network-related information over JSON-RPC, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes. For example, a client application could use the `net_peerCount()` method to display the number of peers connected to the node, or the `net_localEnode()` method to display the node's enode URL. 

Here is an example of how the `net_peerCount()` method could be called over JSON-RPC using curl:

```
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

The response would be a JSON object containing the result of the method call:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":42}
```

In this example, the `result` field contains the number of peers connected to the node (42 in this case).
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file defines a class called `NetRpcModule` which implements the `INetRpcModule` interface and provides methods for handling JSON-RPC requests related to network information.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code file depends on the `Nethermind.Core`, `Nethermind.Core.Attributes`, `Nethermind.Logging`, and `System` namespaces.

3. What methods are available in the `NetRpcModule` class?
    
    The `NetRpcModule` class provides methods for handling JSON-RPC requests related to network information, including `net_localAddress()`, `net_localEnode()`, `net_version()`, `net_listening()`, and `net_peerCount()`.
