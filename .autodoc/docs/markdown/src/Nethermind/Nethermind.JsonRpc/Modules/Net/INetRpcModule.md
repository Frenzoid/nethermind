This code defines an interface for the Net JSON-RPC module in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this module is to provide information about the network status of the Ethereum node. 

The interface defines five methods, each of which corresponds to a different network-related query that can be made to the node. These methods are decorated with the `JsonRpcMethod` attribute, which specifies the name of the method as it should appear in the JSON-RPC request, as well as additional metadata such as a description of the method and an example response. 

The `net_localAddress` method returns the local address of the node as an Ethereum address. The `net_localEnode` method returns the local enode URL of the node, which is a unique identifier for the node on the network. The `net_version` method returns the version number of the Ethereum protocol that the node is running. The `net_listening` method returns a boolean indicating whether the node is currently listening for network connections. Finally, the `net_peerCount` method returns the number of peers that the node is currently connected to on the network. 

This interface is used by the Nethermind JSON-RPC server to expose these network-related queries to clients that connect to the node via JSON-RPC. Clients can make requests to these methods using the appropriate method name and parameters, and the server will respond with the requested information. 

Example usage of this interface might look like:

```
// create a JSON-RPC client and connect to the Nethermind node
var client = new JsonRpcClient("http://localhost:8545");
await client.ConnectAsync();

// call the net_version method to get the protocol version
var version = await client.InvokeAsync<string>("net_version");

// call the net_peerCount method to get the number of connected peers
var peerCount = await client.InvokeAsync<long>("net_peerCount");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines an interface `INetRpcModule` with several methods for a JSON-RPC module related to networking in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `RpcModule` and `JsonRpcMethod` attributes?
   - The `RpcModule` attribute specifies the type of module that the interface belongs to, while the `JsonRpcMethod` attribute provides additional metadata for each method, such as a description and example response.

3. What types of results are returned by the methods in this interface?
   - The methods in this interface return `ResultWrapper` objects that wrap various types of data, such as `Address`, `string`, `bool`, and `long`. These wrappers provide additional information about the result, such as whether it was successful or not.
