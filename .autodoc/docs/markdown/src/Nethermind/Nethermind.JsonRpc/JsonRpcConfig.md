The `JsonRpcConfig` class is a configuration class for the JSON-RPC server in the Nethermind project. It contains properties that define the behavior of the server, such as the host and port to listen on, the enabled modules, and the maximum size of a batch response body. 

One notable property is `EnabledModules`, which is an array of strings that specifies the names of the JSON-RPC modules that should be enabled. The `ModuleType.DefaultModules` property is used to populate this array with the default modules, which include `eth`, `net`, `web3`, and others. Developers can add or remove modules from this array to customize the behavior of the server.

Another important property is `MaxBatchResponseBodySize`, which specifies the maximum size of a batch response body in bytes. This property is set to 30 MB by default, but can be changed to a different value if needed.

The `JsonRpcConfig` class also contains properties for configuring the JSON-RPC recorder, which is used to record JSON-RPC requests and responses for debugging purposes. The `RpcRecorderBaseFilePath` property specifies the base file path for the recorder logs, and the `RpcRecorderState` property specifies whether the recorder is enabled or disabled.

Overall, the `JsonRpcConfig` class provides a way to configure the JSON-RPC server in the Nethermind project to suit the needs of different applications. Developers can use this class to customize the behavior of the server and enable or disable specific modules as needed. Below is an example of how to create a new instance of the `JsonRpcConfig` class and set some of its properties:

```
var config = new JsonRpcConfig
{
    Enabled = true,
    Host = "0.0.0.0",
    Port = 8080,
    EnabledModules = new[] { "eth", "net" },
    MaxBatchResponseBodySize = 50.MB()
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `JsonRpcConfig` which implements an interface `IJsonRpcConfig` and contains various properties related to JSON-RPC configuration.

2. What is the significance of the `Default` field?
   - The `Default` field is a static instance of the `JsonRpcConfig` class that can be used as a default configuration for JSON-RPC.

3. What are some of the configurable properties of the `JsonRpcConfig` class?
   - Some of the configurable properties of the `JsonRpcConfig` class include `Enabled`, `Host`, `Port`, `WebSocketsPort`, `EnabledModules`, `GasCap`, `BufferResponses`, `MaxRequestBodySize`, `JwtSecretFile`, `UnsecureDevNoRpcAuthentication`, `EngineHost`, `EnginePort`, `EngineEnabledModules`, `MaxBatchSize`, and `MaxBatchResponseBodySize`.
