This code defines an enumeration called `InvocationType` within the `Nethermind.GitBook` namespace. The `InvocationType` enumeration has three possible values: `JsonRpc`, `Cli`, and `Both`. 

This enumeration is likely used in other parts of the Nethermind project to specify the type of invocation that should be used for a particular operation. For example, if a user wants to interact with the Nethermind software via the command line interface (CLI), they would specify `InvocationType.Cli`. If they want to interact with the software via the JSON-RPC API, they would specify `InvocationType.JsonRpc`. If they want to be able to use both methods of invocation, they would specify `InvocationType.Both`.

Here is an example of how this enumeration might be used in code:

```
using Nethermind.GitBook;

public class MyNethermindClass
{
    public void DoSomething(InvocationType invocationType)
    {
        if (invocationType == InvocationType.Cli)
        {
            // Do something via the CLI
        }
        else if (invocationType == InvocationType.JsonRpc)
        {
            // Do something via the JSON-RPC API
        }
        else if (invocationType == InvocationType.Both)
        {
            // Do something via both the CLI and JSON-RPC API
        }
    }
}
```

Overall, this code provides a simple way to specify the type of invocation that should be used for a particular operation within the Nethermind project.
