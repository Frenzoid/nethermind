The `EnrDiscoveryTests` class is a test suite for the `EnrDiscovery` class, which is responsible for discovering Ethereum nodes on the network using Ethereum Name Service (ENS) records. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `EnrDiscovery` class is able to correctly discover nodes on the network using ENS records.

The `Test_enr_discovery` method is a test case that tests the ability of the `EnrDiscovery` class to discover nodes on the network using a given ENS URL. The method takes a single parameter, `url`, which is the ENS URL to use for discovery. The method creates an instance of the `NodeRecordSigner` class, which is used to sign and verify node records. It also creates an instance of the `EnrDiscovery` class, passing in an instance of the `EnrRecordParser` class and an instance of the `TestErrorLogManager` class. The `EnrRecordParser` class is used to parse node records, while the `TestErrorLogManager` class is used to log any errors that occur during discovery.

The method then creates an instance of the `NetworkConfig` class, which is used to configure the network settings for discovery. It sets the `DiscoveryDns` property of the `NetworkConfig` instance to the `url` parameter. It then creates an instance of the `Stopwatch` class, which is used to measure the time taken for discovery. The method also creates a counter variable, `added`, which is used to count the number of nodes that are discovered.

The method then attaches an event handler to the `NodeAdded` event of the `EnrDiscovery` instance. The event handler increments the `added` counter variable each time a node is added. The method then calls the `SearchTree` method of the `EnrDiscovery` instance, passing in the `DiscoveryDns` property of the `NetworkConfig` instance. This method performs the actual discovery of nodes on the network.

After discovery is complete, the method outputs the number of nodes that were added and the time taken for discovery. It then iterates over any errors that were logged during discovery and outputs them to the console. Finally, the method asserts that the number of nodes that were added is equal to 3000.

The `Test_enr_discovery2` method is another test case that tests the ability of the `EnrDiscovery` class to discover nodes on the network using a given ENS URL. The method creates an instance of the `NodeRecordSigner` class and an instance of the `EnrRecordParser` class, which are used to sign and parse node records, respectively. It also creates an instance of the `EnrTreeCrawler` class, which is used to crawl the ENS tree and discover nodes.

The method then creates a counter variable, `verified`, which is used to count the number of nodes that are verified. It then iterates over each node record that is discovered by the `EnrTreeCrawler` instance. For each node record, the method parses the record using the `EnrRecordParser` instance and verifies that the parsed record matches the original record. If the record is verified, the `verified` counter variable is incremented.

After all node records have been processed, the method outputs the number of nodes that were verified.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the `EnrDiscovery` class is able to correctly discover nodes on the network using ENS records. It tests the ability of the class to discover nodes using different ENS URLs and verifies that the correct number of nodes are discovered.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is for testing the EnrDiscovery class which is used for discovering Ethereum nodes on the network.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has external dependencies on DotNetty, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute, and NUnit.

3. What is the expected output of the `Test_enr_discovery` method?
   - The `Test_enr_discovery` method is expected to add 3000 nodes to the `enrDiscovery` object and output the number of nodes added in the elapsed time. It also checks for any errors that occurred during the search and outputs them.
