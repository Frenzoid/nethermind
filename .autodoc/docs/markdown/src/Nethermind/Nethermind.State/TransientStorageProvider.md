The `TransientStorageProvider` class is a part of the Nethermind project and provides a transient store for contracts that doesn't persist storage across calls. This class is based on the EIP-1153 standard, which defines a way to store contract data that is not persisted across calls. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store data that is only needed for the duration of a single transaction, and is not required to be persisted to the blockchain.

The `TransientStorageProvider` class is a subclass of the `PartialStorageProviderBase` class, which provides a base implementation for storage providers. The `TransientStorageProvider` class overrides the `GetCurrentValue` method, which is used to retrieve the value of a storage cell. This method takes a `StorageCell` object as a parameter, which represents the location of the storage cell in the contract's storage.

The `GetCurrentValue` method first checks if the value of the storage cell is already cached. If it is, the cached value is returned. If not, the method returns a default value of zero. This means that if a storage cell has not been written to yet, its value will be zero.

The `TransientStorageProvider` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way to store contract data that is only needed for the duration of a single transaction. This can be useful for storing temporary data that is not required to be persisted to the blockchain, such as intermediate results of a computation. By using a transient storage provider, the Nethermind project can reduce the amount of data that needs to be persisted to the blockchain, which can help to improve performance and reduce storage costs.

Example usage:

```
// create a new transient storage provider
TransientStorageProvider provider = new TransientStorageProvider(logManager);

// get the value of a storage cell
StorageCell cell = new StorageCell(0x1234);
byte[] value = provider.GetCurrentValue(cell);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PartialStorageProviderBase` class that `TransientStorageProvider` inherits from?
   
   `PartialStorageProviderBase` is a base class that provides partial implementation of the `IStorageProvider` interface, which is used to interact with the storage of the Ethereum state trie.

2. What is the significance of the `TryGetCachedValue` method called in the `GetCurrentValue` method?
   
   `TryGetCachedValue` is used to check if the value of a storage cell has already been cached in memory. If it has, the cached value is returned. Otherwise, `_zeroValue` is returned.

3. What is the purpose of the `EIP-1153` standard mentioned in the code comments?
   
   `EIP-1153` is a standard proposed by the Ethereum community that provides a transient store for contracts that doesn't persist storage across calls. The `TransientStorageProvider` class is an implementation of this standard.
