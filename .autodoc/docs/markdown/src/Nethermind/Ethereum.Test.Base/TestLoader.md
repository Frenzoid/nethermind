The `TestLoader` class is a utility class that provides methods for loading and preparing test data from JSON files. It is part of the Ethereum.Test.Base namespace and is used in the larger project to facilitate testing of Ethereum-related functionality.

The `PrepareInput` method takes an object as input and returns a modified version of that object. If the input is a string that starts with a "#" character, it is assumed to be a BigInteger value and is converted to a BigInteger object. If the input is a JArray, each element of the array is recursively passed through the `PrepareInput` method and the resulting array is returned. If the input is a JToken, it is checked for type and returned as a string or long value if appropriate. Otherwise, the input is returned unchanged.

The `LoadFromFile` method takes two type parameters, `TContainer` and `TTest`, and a string parameter `testFileName`. It also takes a `testExtractor` function that takes a `TContainer` object and returns an `IEnumerable<TTest>` object. The method loads a JSON file with the name `testFileName` from the assembly that contains the `TTest` type. It then deserializes the JSON into a `TContainer` object and passes it to the `testExtractor` function to extract the individual test cases. The resulting `IEnumerable<TTest>` object is returned.

This class is used in the larger project to load test data from JSON files and prepare it for use in test cases. For example, a test case might use the `LoadFromFile` method to load a JSON file containing a list of transactions to test. The `PrepareInput` method might be used to convert string values to BigInteger objects or to recursively prepare arrays of test data. The resulting test data can then be used to test Ethereum-related functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PrepareInput` method?
- The `PrepareInput` method is used to convert input data into the appropriate format for testing.

2. What is the purpose of the `LoadFromFile` method?
- The `LoadFromFile` method is used to load test data from a file and extract the relevant tests for a given container.

3. What is the purpose of the `Ethereum.Test.Base` namespace?
- The `Ethereum.Test.Base` namespace contains code related to testing Ethereum functionality.
