The `LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy` class is a part of the Ethereum.Test.Base namespace and implements the `ITestLoadStrategy` interface. It provides a strategy for loading blockchain tests from a specified directory. The purpose of this class is to load all the blockchain tests from a given directory and return them as an enumerable collection of `IEthereumTest` objects.

The `Load` method takes two parameters: `testsDirectoryName` and `wildcard`. The `testsDirectoryName` parameter specifies the name of the directory containing the blockchain tests. If the directory name is not an absolute path, the method searches for the directory in the project's source code directory. The `wildcard` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies a pattern to match against the test file names.

The `Load` method first checks if the `testsDirectoryName` parameter is an absolute path or not. If it is not an absolute path, the method calls the `GetBlockchainTestsDirectory` method to get the absolute path of the blockchain tests directory. It then uses the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` method to get all the subdirectories of the blockchain tests directory that match the `testsDirectoryName` parameter. If the `testsDirectoryName` parameter is an absolute path, the method creates an array containing only the specified directory.

The method then calls the `LoadTestsFromDirectory` method for each directory found in the previous step. The `LoadTestsFromDirectory` method loads all the test files from the specified directory and returns them as a collection of `BlockchainTest` objects. It uses the `Directory.EnumerateFiles` method to get all the test files in the directory and creates a `FileTestsSource` object for each file. It then calls the `LoadBlockchainTests` method of the `FileTestsSource` object to load the tests from the file. If the loading is successful, it sets the `Category` property of each `BlockchainTest` object to the name of the directory and adds the tests to the `testsByName` collection. If the loading fails, it creates a new `BlockchainTest` object with the `LoadFailure` property set to the error message and adds it to the `testsByName` collection.

Finally, the `Load` method returns the `testsByName` collection as an enumerable collection of `IEthereumTest` objects.

Overall, the `LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy` class provides a convenient way to load all the blockchain tests from a specified directory and use them in the larger project. Here is an example of how to use this class:

```csharp
LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy strategy = new LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy();
IEnumerable<IEthereumTest> tests = strategy.Load("my_tests_directory", "*.json");

foreach (IEthereumTest test in tests)
{
    // Run the test
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy` class?
    
    The `LoadBlockchainTestsStrategy` class is an implementation of the `ITestLoadStrategy` interface and provides a method to load Ethereum tests from a specified directory.

2. What is the `Load` method doing?
    
    The `Load` method takes in a directory name and an optional wildcard pattern, and returns an enumerable collection of Ethereum tests loaded from the specified directory and its subdirectories. If the directory name is not an absolute path, it searches for the directory relative to the blockchain tests directory.

3. What is the purpose of the `LoadTestsFromDirectory` method?
    
    The `LoadTestsFromDirectory` method takes in a directory name and an optional wildcard pattern, and returns an enumerable collection of `BlockchainTest` objects loaded from the specified directory. It uses a `FileTestsSource` object to load the tests from the files in the directory and catches any exceptions that occur during the loading process.
