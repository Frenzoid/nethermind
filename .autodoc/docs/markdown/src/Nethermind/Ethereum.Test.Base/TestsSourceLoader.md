The `TestsSourceLoader` class is a part of the nethermind project and is used to load Ethereum tests from a specified path. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to load tests from a given path and return them as an enumerable collection of `IEthereumTest` objects. 

The class takes in three parameters: `ITestLoadStrategy`, `path`, and `wildcard`. The `ITestLoadStrategy` parameter is an interface that defines a method to load tests from a given path. The `path` parameter is a string that represents the path where the tests are located. The `wildcard` parameter is an optional string that represents a pattern to match the test files. 

The `TestsSourceLoader` class has a single public method called `LoadTests()`. This method calls the `Load()` method of the `_testLoadStrategy` object, passing in the `path` and `wildcard` parameters. The `Load()` method returns an enumerable collection of `IEthereumTest` objects, which is then returned by the `LoadTests()` method.

This class can be used in the larger nethermind project to load Ethereum tests from a specified path. For example, a developer can create an instance of the `TestsSourceLoader` class and pass in the appropriate parameters to load tests from a specific directory. The returned collection of tests can then be used to run automated tests or to perform other testing-related tasks.

Example usage:

```
ITestLoadStrategy testLoadStrategy = new MyTestLoadStrategy();
string path = "C:/mytests";
string wildcard = "*.json";
TestsSourceLoader loader = new TestsSourceLoader(testLoadStrategy, path, wildcard);
IEnumerable<IEthereumTest> tests = loader.LoadTests();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ITestSourceLoader` interface and how is it used in this code?
   - The `ITestSourceLoader` interface is used to define a contract for loading Ethereum tests, and this code implements the interface with the `TestsSourceLoader` class which loads tests using a specified strategy and path.
2. What is the significance of the `wildcard` parameter in the `TestsSourceLoader` constructor?
   - The `wildcard` parameter is an optional parameter that allows for filtering of the tests loaded by the `TestsSourceLoader` based on a specified pattern.
3. What is the role of the `LoadTests` method in the `TestsSourceLoader` class?
   - The `LoadTests` method is responsible for actually loading the tests using the specified strategy and path, and returns an enumerable collection of `IEthereumTest` objects representing the loaded tests.
