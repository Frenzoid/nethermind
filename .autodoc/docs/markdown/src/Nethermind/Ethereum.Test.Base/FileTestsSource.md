The `FileTestsSource` class is a utility class that provides methods for loading Ethereum tests from files. It is part of the nethermind project and is used to load tests for Ethereum clients. The class takes a file name and an optional wildcard as input and provides two methods for loading tests: `LoadGeneralStateTests` and `LoadBlockchainTests`.

The `LoadGeneralStateTests` method loads general state tests from the file specified by the file name. It first checks if the file name starts with a dot, which indicates a hidden file, and returns an empty list if it does. It then checks if the file name contains the wildcard, if provided, and returns an empty list if it does not. If the file passes these checks, it reads the contents of the file as a JSON string and converts it to a list of `GeneralStateTest` objects using the `JsonToEthereumTest.Convert` method. If an exception occurs during this process, it returns a list containing a single `GeneralStateTest` object with the name of the file and the exception message.

The `LoadBlockchainTests` method loads blockchain tests from the file specified by the file name. It performs the same checks as the `LoadGeneralStateTests` method and returns an empty list if the file fails any of them. If the file passes the checks, it reads the contents of the file as a JSON string using the default encoding and converts it to a list of `BlockchainTest` objects using the `JsonToEthereumTest.ConvertToBlockchainTests` method. If an exception occurs during this process, it returns a list containing a single `BlockchainTest` object with the name of the file and the exception message.

Overall, the `FileTestsSource` class provides a convenient way to load Ethereum tests from files and convert them to objects that can be used in the nethermind project. Here is an example of how to use the `FileTestsSource` class to load general state tests:

```csharp
var fileTestsSource = new FileTestsSource("generalStateTests.json");
var generalStateTests = fileTestsSource.LoadGeneralStateTests();
foreach (var test in generalStateTests)
{
    // Do something with the test
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadGeneralStateTests` method?
   - The `LoadGeneralStateTests` method is used to load and convert JSON files to `GeneralStateTest` objects.
2. What is the purpose of the `_wildcard` field?
   - The `_wildcard` field is used to filter the files that are loaded based on a specific pattern.
3. What happens if an exception is thrown while loading the tests?
   - If an exception is thrown while loading the tests, a new test object is created with the name of the file and the exception message as the `LoadFailure` property.
