The `IndexesJson` class is a simple data structure that represents three integer values: `Data`, `Gas`, and `Value`. It is likely used in the larger project to store and manipulate data related to Ethereum transactions or blocks. 

For example, if we wanted to create an instance of `IndexesJson` and set its values, we could do the following:

```
IndexesJson indexes = new IndexesJson();
indexes.Data = 123;
indexes.Gas = 456;
indexes.Value = 789;
```

We could then access these values later on by using the dot notation:

```
int data = indexes.Data; // data = 123
int gas = indexes.Gas; // gas = 456
int value = indexes.Value; // value = 789
```

Overall, the `IndexesJson` class is a simple but important component of the nethermind project, as it allows developers to store and manipulate data related to Ethereum transactions and blocks in a structured and organized way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IndexesJson` class?
   - The `IndexesJson` class is used in the Ethereum.Test.Base namespace and contains three properties: `Data`, `Gas`, and `Value`.

2. What type of data does the `Data`, `Gas`, and `Value` properties hold?
   - The `Data`, `Gas`, and `Value` properties are all of type `int`.

3. Is this code part of a larger project or module?
   - Yes, this code is part of a larger project called `nethermind`.
