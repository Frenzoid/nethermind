The `TestContractBlockchain` class is a subclass of the `TestBlockchain` class and is used for testing smart contracts on the Nethermind blockchain implementation. It provides a way to create a blockchain instance with a specific chain specification for testing purposes. 

The `ChainSpec` property is used to store the chain specification for the blockchain instance. The `GetGenesisBlock` method is overridden to load the genesis block using the `GenesisLoader` class. The `ForTest` method is a factory method that creates an instance of the `TestContractBlockchain` class with a specific chain specification for testing purposes. 

The `GetSpecProvider` method is used to load the chain specification from a JSON file and create a `ChainSpecBasedSpecProvider` instance. The `ChainSpecLoader` class is used to load the chain specification from a JSON string. The JSON string is read from a file that is embedded as a resource in the assembly. The name of the resource is constructed from the name of the test class and an optional suffix. 

The `SealEngineType` property is set to `Nethermind.Core.SealEngineType.AuRa`, which indicates that the blockchain instance uses the AuRa consensus algorithm. 

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide a way to test smart contracts on the Nethermind blockchain implementation. It is used in conjunction with other testing classes and tools to ensure that smart contracts work as expected on the Nethermind blockchain. 

Example usage:

```csharp
var test = await TestContractBlockchain.ForTest<TestContractBlockchain, TestContractBlockchainTests>();
var block = test.GetGenesisBlock();
```

This code creates an instance of the `TestContractBlockchain` class with the chain specification loaded from the `TestContractBlockchainTests.json` resource file. It then gets the genesis block for the blockchain instance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file defines a class called `TestContractBlockchain` that extends another class called `TestBlockchain`. It also includes a static method called `ForTest` that returns an instance of `TestContractBlockchain`.

2. What is the significance of the `ChainSpec` property and how is it used?
    
    The `ChainSpec` property is an instance of the `ChainSpec` class and is used to specify the configuration of the blockchain. It is used in the `GetGenesisBlock` method to load the genesis block of the blockchain.

3. What is the purpose of the `ForTest` method and how is it used?
    
    The `ForTest` method is a factory method that returns an instance of `TestContractBlockchain` with a specified `ChainSpec`. It is used to create instances of `TestContractBlockchain` for testing purposes.
