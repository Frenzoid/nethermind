The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaStepsTests` class is a test suite for the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class, which is responsible for triggering block production events in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The tests in this suite verify that the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class behaves correctly under different conditions.

The first test, `should_cancel_block_production_trigger_on_next_step_if_not_finished_yet`, tests that if a block production event is triggered but not finished before the next step, it should be cancelled. The test creates an instance of `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` and subscribes to the `TriggerBlockProduction` event. When the event is triggered, the test delays the block production task by a duration of 10 steps, which is longer than the time between steps. The test then waits for four block production events to be triggered, which should be enough to cover two steps. After the test is complete, it checks that all but the last block production event were cancelled.

The second test, `should_not_cancel_block_production_trigger_on_next_step_finished`, tests that if a block production event is triggered and finished before the next step, it should not be cancelled. The test is similar to the first test, but it does not delay the block production task. Instead, it waits for two block production events to be triggered, which should be enough to cover one step. After the test is complete, it checks that none of the block production events were cancelled.

The `TestAuRaStepCalculator` class is a helper class that implements the `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface. This class is used to calculate the current step and the time to the next step in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `CurrentStep` property returns the current step based on the current Unix time. The `TimeToNextStep` property returns the time until the next step based on the current Unix time. The `TimeToStep` method returns the time until a specific step based on the current Unix time. The `CurrentStepDuration` property is not implemented.

Overall, the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaStepsTests` class tests the correct behavior of the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaSteps` class, which is responsible for triggering block production events in the AuRa consensus algorithm. The `TestAuRaStepCalculator` class is a helper class that provides time calculations for the tests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildBlocksOnAuRaStepsTests` class?
- The `BuildBlocksOnAuRaStepsTests` class is a test class that contains two test methods for testing block production triggers in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

2. What is the `TestAuRaStepCalculator` class used for?
- The `TestAuRaStepCalculator` class is an implementation of the `IAuRaStepCalculator` interface that provides methods for calculating the current step, time to next step, and time to a specific step in the AuRa consensus algorithm.

3. What is the purpose of the `should_cancel_block_production_trigger_on_next_step_if_not_finished_yet` test method?
- The `should_cancel_block_production_trigger_on_next_step_if_not_finished_yet` test method tests whether the block production trigger is cancelled on the next step if it has not finished yet. It does this by delaying the block production task for a duration longer than the step duration, and then checking whether the cancellation token has been requested for all but the last block production event.
