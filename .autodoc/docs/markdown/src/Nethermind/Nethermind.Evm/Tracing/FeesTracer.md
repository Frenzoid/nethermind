The `FeesTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for tracing fees in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions. It implements the `IBlockTracer` and `ITxTracer` interfaces, which define methods for tracing blocks and transactions, respectively. 

The purpose of this class is to track the fees associated with EVM transactions. It provides a way to report the fees and burnt fees for a transaction, as well as to reset the fees and burnt fees for a new block. The `ReportFees` method is used to report the fees and burnt fees for a transaction, while the `StartNewBlockTrace` method is used to reset the fees and burnt fees for a new block. 

The class also provides a number of properties and methods for determining what types of tracing are enabled. For example, the `IsTracingFees` property is set to `true`, indicating that fees tracing is enabled. Other properties, such as `IsTracingState` and `IsTracingActions`, are set to `false`, indicating that tracing of state and actions is not enabled. 

The `Fees` and `BurntFees` properties are used to store the total fees and burnt fees for a transaction. These properties are updated by the `ReportFees` method, which adds the fees and burnt fees for a transaction to the existing totals. 

Overall, the `FeesTracer` class provides a way to trace fees for EVM transactions in the Nethermind project. It is used to track the fees and burnt fees for a transaction, and to reset these values for a new block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `FeesTracer` class that implements `IBlockTracer` and `ITxTracer` interfaces for tracing fees in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions and blocks.

2. What methods and properties are available in the `FeesTracer` class?
- The `FeesTracer` class has methods for reporting fees, starting and ending block and transaction traces, and reporting various changes and actions in the EVM. It also has properties for checking if tracing fees is enabled and for getting the total fees and burnt fees.

3. What other interfaces does the `FeesTracer` class implement?
- The `FeesTracer` class implements `IBlockTracer` and `ITxTracer` interfaces, which define methods for tracing blocks and transactions in the EVM.
