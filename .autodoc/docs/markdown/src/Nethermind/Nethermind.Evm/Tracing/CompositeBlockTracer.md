The `CompositeBlockTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for tracing blocks and transactions in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is responsible for managing a collection of child tracers and delegating tracing operations to them. 

The class implements two interfaces: `IBlockTracer` and `ITracerBag`. The former defines methods for tracing blocks and transactions, while the latter provides methods for adding and removing child tracers. 

The `CompositeBlockTracer` maintains a list of child tracers `_childTracers` and provides methods for adding, removing, and iterating over them. When a new block trace is started, the `StartNewBlockTrace` method is called on each child tracer. Similarly, when a new transaction trace is started, the `StartNewTxTrace` method is called on each child tracer, and the resulting transaction tracers are aggregated into a `CompositeTxTracer`. 

The `CompositeBlockTracer` also provides methods for reporting rewards and ending traces. The `ReportReward` method is called on each child tracer that is tracing rewards, and the `EndTxTrace` and `EndBlockTrace` methods are called on each child tracer to signal the end of a transaction or block trace, respectively. 

One important property of the `CompositeBlockTracer` is `IsTracingRewards`, which is set to `true` if any of the child tracers are tracing rewards. This property is used to determine whether to call the `ReportReward` method on each child tracer. 

Overall, the `CompositeBlockTracer` is a useful tool for managing multiple tracers in the EVM. It allows for easy aggregation of transaction tracers and provides a simple interface for adding and removing child tracers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeBlockTracer` class?
    
    The `CompositeBlockTracer` class is used to manage a collection of `IBlockTracer` instances and provides methods to start and end tracing for blocks and transactions.

2. What is the significance of the `IsTracingRewards` property?
    
    The `IsTracingRewards` property is used to determine whether any of the child tracers are tracing rewards. It is set to true if any of the child tracers have `IsTracingRewards` set to true.

3. What is the purpose of the `ITracerBag` interface?
    
    The `ITracerBag` interface is implemented by the `CompositeBlockTracer` class and provides methods to add, remove, and get child tracers. It is used to manage a collection of `IBlockTracer` instances.
