The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used for tracing the execution of Ethereum transactions and blocks. It implements the `IBlockTracer`, `ITxTracer`, and `IJournal<int>` interfaces. 

The purpose of this class is to trace the execution of transactions and blocks and generate receipts for each transaction. These receipts contain information such as the amount of gas used, the status code of the transaction (success or failure), the logs generated, and the state root after the transaction has been executed. 

The class provides methods for marking a transaction as successful or failed, building receipts, and reporting changes to memory, storage, and the stack. It also supports nested receipt tracers and can be used to trace rewards and fees. 

The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide detailed information about the execution of transactions and blocks. This information can be used for debugging, auditing, and analysis purposes. 

Example usage of the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class:

```csharp
BlockReceiptsTracer tracer = new BlockReceiptsTracer();
Block block = new Block();
tracer.StartNewBlockTrace(block);

Transaction tx = new Transaction();
ITxTracer txTracer = tracer.StartNewTxTrace(tx);

// execute transaction
txTracer.ReportAction(100000, 0, Address.Zero, Address.One, new byte[0], ExecutionType.Call);
txTracer.ReportActionEnd(90000, new byte[0]);

tracer.MarkAsSuccess(Address.One, 10000, new byte[0], new LogEntry[0]);

tracer.EndTxTrace();
tracer.EndBlockTrace();

foreach (TxReceipt receipt in tracer.TxReceipts)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Transaction {receipt.TxHash} executed with status code {receipt.StatusCode}");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class?
- The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class is a tracer for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions and blocks that is used to build transaction receipts and track state changes during execution.

2. What interfaces does the `BlockReceiptsTracer` class implement?
- The `BlockReceiptsTracer` class implements the `IBlockTracer`, `ITxTracer`, and `IJournal<int>` interfaces.

3. What is the significance of the `MarkAsSuccess` and `MarkAsFailed` methods?
- The `MarkAsSuccess` and `MarkAsFailed` methods are used to mark a transaction as successful or failed, respectively, and to add the resulting transaction receipt to the list of receipts being tracked by the tracer.
