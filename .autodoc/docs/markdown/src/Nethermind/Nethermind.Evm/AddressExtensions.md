The `ContractAddress` class in the `Nethermind` project provides two static methods for generating Ethereum contract addresses. 

The first method, `From(Address? deployingAddress, in UInt256 nonce)`, takes an optional `deployingAddress` parameter and a `nonce` parameter. It generates a contract address by computing the Keccak-256 hash of the RLP-encoded sequence of the `deployingAddress` and `nonce`. The resulting hash is then used to create a new `Address` object, which represents the contract address. 

The second method, `From(Address deployingAddress, Span<byte> salt, Span<byte> initCode)`, takes a `deployingAddress` parameter, a `salt` parameter, and an `initCode` parameter. It generates a contract address by computing the Keccak-256 hash of the concatenation of the following values: 

- `0xff`: a prefix byte used to indicate that the address is being generated from a contract creation transaction
- `deployingAddress`: the address of the account that is deploying the contract
- `salt`: a random value used to prevent collisions between different contracts deployed by the same account
- `sha3(initCode)`: the Keccak-256 hash of the contract's initialization code

The resulting hash is then used to create a new `Address` object, which represents the contract address. 

These methods are useful for generating contract addresses in a deterministic way, which is important for certain use cases such as contract verification and contract factory contracts. 

Example usage: 

```
Address deployingAddress = new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");
UInt256 nonce = UInt256.FromInt32(0);
Address contractAddress = ContractAddress.From(deployingAddress, nonce);
```

```
Address deployingAddress = new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");
Span<byte> salt = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
Span<byte> initCode = new byte[] { 0x60, 0x80, 0x60, 0x40 };
Address contractAddress = ContractAddress.From(deployingAddress, salt, initCode);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ContractAddress` class?
    
    The `ContractAddress` class provides static methods for generating contract addresses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

2. What is the difference between the two `From` methods in the `ContractAddress` class?
    
    The first `From` method takes an optional `deployingAddress` parameter and a `nonce` parameter to generate a contract address, while the second `From` method takes a `deployingAddress` parameter, a `salt` parameter, and an `initCode` parameter to generate a contract address.

3. What is the role of the `ValueKeccak` class in generating contract addresses?
    
    The `ValueKeccak` class is used to compute the Keccak-256 hash of the input data, which is then used to generate the contract address.
