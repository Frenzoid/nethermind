The `DbConfig` class is a configuration class that defines the default settings for various databases used in the Nethermind project. The class implements the `IDbConfig` interface, which defines the properties that can be set for each database. 

The class contains a large number of properties, each of which corresponds to a specific database used in the project. For example, the `WriteBufferSize` property sets the size of the write buffer for the main database, while the `ReceiptsDbWriteBufferSize` property sets the size of the write buffer for the receipts database. 

Each property has a default value, which can be overridden by setting the property to a new value. For example, to set the write buffer size for the main database to 32 MB, you would set the `WriteBufferSize` property to `(ulong)32.MiB()`. 

The class also includes properties for various database options, such as the maximum number of open files and the maximum write bytes per second. These options can be set using the `MaxOpenFiles` and `MaxWriteBytesPerSec` properties, respectively. 

Overall, the `DbConfig` class provides a convenient way to configure the various databases used in the Nethermind project. By setting the properties of this class, developers can customize the behavior of the databases to suit their needs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `DbConfig` that contains properties for configuring various databases used in the `nethermind` project, such as the block database, receipts database, and pending transactions database.

2. What are some of the default values for the database configuration properties?
- Some of the default values include a write buffer size of 16 MiB for the main block database, a block cache size of 64 MiB for the main block database, and a write buffer size of 8 MiB for the receipts database.

3. Are there any properties that are not currently being used or are marked as TODO?
- Yes, there is a property called `CanonicalHashTrieDb` that is marked as TODO and has default values that may need to be customized based on profiling.
