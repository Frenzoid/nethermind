The `PerTableDbConfig` class is responsible for reading configuration options for a specific RocksDB table. It takes in an `IDbConfig` object, a `RocksDbSettings` object, and an optional `columnName` string. The `IDbConfig` object contains configuration options for the entire database, while the `RocksDbSettings` object contains configuration options for the specific RocksDB instance. The `columnName` string is used to differentiate between tables that have the same name but different columns.

The class has several public properties that return specific configuration options for the table. These properties include `CacheIndexAndFilterBlocks`, `BlockCacheSize`, `WriteBufferSize`, `WriteBufferNumber`, `AdditionalRocksDbOptions`, `MaxOpenFiles`, `MaxWriteBytesPerSec`, `RecycleLogFileNum`, `WriteAheadLogSync`, `EnableDbStatistics`, and `StatsDumpPeriodSec`. These properties either return the value of the corresponding property in the `RocksDbSettings` object or call the `ReadConfig` method to read the value from the `IDbConfig` object.

The `ReadConfig` method is a private method that takes in a generic type parameter `T`, a string `propertyName`, and a string `prefix`. It uses reflection to read the value of the property with the given name and prefix from the `IDbConfig` object. If the property is nullable, it checks if it is null before returning the value. If the property with the given prefix does not exist, it falls back to the property with the given name.

Overall, the `PerTableDbConfig` class provides a way to read configuration options for a specific RocksDB table. It is used in the larger Nethermind project to configure the RocksDB instances used by the database. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
var dbConfig = new DbConfig();
var rocksDbSettings = new RocksDbSettings();
var perTableDbConfig = new PerTableDbConfig(dbConfig, rocksDbSettings, "transactions");
var blockCacheSize = perTableDbConfig.BlockCacheSize;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `PerTableDbConfig` that provides configuration options for a RocksDB database table.

2. What are some of the configurable options available through this class?
- Some of the configurable options include cache size, write buffer size, write buffer number, and maximum number of open files.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReadConfig` method?
- The `ReadConfig` method is used to read a configuration value from an `IDbConfig` object, using a specified property name and prefix. It returns the value as a nullable generic type.
