The `DiscoveryManagerTests` class is a test suite for the `DiscoveryManager` class in the Nethermind project. The `DiscoveryManager` class is responsible for managing the discovery protocol in the Ethereum network. The discovery protocol is used to discover other nodes in the network and exchange information about them. The `DiscoveryManagerTests` class tests the functionality of the `DiscoveryManager` class by simulating various scenarios and verifying the expected behavior.

The `DiscoveryManagerTests` class contains several test methods that simulate different scenarios. The `Initialize` method is called before each test method and initializes the necessary objects and configurations. The `DiscoveryManager` object is created with a `NodeTable`, `NetworkStorage`, and `DiscoveryConfig` objects. The `NodeTable` object is responsible for storing information about other nodes in the network. The `NetworkStorage` object is responsible for storing information about the network. The `DiscoveryConfig` object contains the configuration settings for the discovery protocol.

The `OnPingMessageTest` method simulates the scenario where a ping message is received. The `DiscoveryManager` object receives the ping message and sends a pong message in response. The method verifies that the pong message was sent and that a ping message was sent to the new node.

The `OnPongMessageTest` method simulates the scenario where a pong message is received. The `DiscoveryManager` object receives the pong message and activates the node as a valid peer. The method verifies that the node is activated as a valid peer.

The `OnFindNodeMessageTest` method simulates the scenario where a findNode message is received. The `DiscoveryManager` object receives the findNode message and responds with a neighbors message. The method verifies that the neighbors message was sent.

The `MemoryTest` method simulates the scenario where multiple pong messages are received. The method receives pong messages from multiple nodes and verifies that the nodes are added to the `NodeTable`.

The `OnNeighborsMessageTest` method simulates the scenario where a neighbors message is received. The `DiscoveryManager` object receives the neighbors message and sends ping messages to the nodes in the message. The method verifies that the ping messages were sent.

Overall, the `DiscoveryManagerTests` class tests the functionality of the `DiscoveryManager` class by simulating various scenarios and verifying the expected behavior. The tests ensure that the discovery protocol is working correctly and that nodes are being discovered and added to the `NodeTable`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryManager` class?
- The `DiscoveryManager` class is responsible for managing the discovery protocol for a node in the network.

2. What is the purpose of the `OnPingMessageTest` method?
- The `OnPingMessageTest` method tests the behavior of the `DiscoveryManager` when it receives a `PingMsg` message, by verifying that it sends a `PongMsg` message in response and sends a `PingMsg` message to a new node.

3. What is the purpose of the `MemoryTest` method?
- The `MemoryTest` method tests the memory usage of the `DiscoveryManager` by simulating the receipt of a large number of `PongMsg` messages.
