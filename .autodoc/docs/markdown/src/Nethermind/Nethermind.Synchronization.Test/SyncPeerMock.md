The `SyncPeerMock` class is a mock implementation of the `ISyncPeer` interface, which is used for synchronizing blockchain data between nodes in the Nethermind project. This class is used for testing purposes to simulate a peer node that can communicate with other nodes in the network.

The `SyncPeerMock` class has several properties and methods that allow it to interact with other nodes in the network. It has a `Node` property that represents the remote node it is connected to, and a `LocalNode` property that represents the local node. It also has properties for the `HeadHash`, `HeadNumber`, and `TotalDifficulty` of the remote node's blockchain.

The `SyncPeerMock` class implements several methods from the `ISyncPeer` interface, including `GetBlockBodies`, `GetBlockHeaders`, `GetHeadBlockHeader`, `NotifyOfNewBlock`, `SendNewTransactions`, `GetReceipts`, and `GetNodeData`. These methods are used to request and send blockchain data between nodes.

The `GetBlockBodies` method is used to request the block bodies for a list of block hashes. It retrieves the blocks from the remote node's blockchain and returns an array of `BlockBody` objects.

The `GetBlockHeaders` method is used to request block headers for a specific block hash or block number. It retrieves the headers from the remote node's blockchain and returns an array of `BlockHeader` objects.

The `GetHeadBlockHeader` method is used to request the header of the current head block of the remote node's blockchain.

The `NotifyOfNewBlock` method is used to notify the remote node of a new block that has been added to the local node's blockchain. It can send the full block or just a hint of the block, depending on the `SendBlockMode` parameter.

The `SendNewTransactions` method is used to send new transactions to the remote node.

The `GetReceipts` method is used to request the transaction receipts for a list of block hashes. It retrieves the receipts from the remote node's blockchain and returns an array of `TxReceipt` objects.

The `GetNodeData` method is used to request node data for a list of hashes. It retrieves the data from the remote node and returns an array of byte arrays.

The `SyncPeerMock` class also has a `RegisterSatelliteProtocol` method and a `TryGetSatelliteProtocol` method, which are not implemented and throw `NotImplementedException`.

Overall, the `SyncPeerMock` class is a useful tool for testing the synchronization of blockchain data between nodes in the Nethermind project. It provides a mock implementation of the `ISyncPeer` interface that can be used to simulate the behavior of a real node in the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncPeerMock` class?
- The `SyncPeerMock` class is used to simulate a synchronization peer for testing purposes.

2. What is the `_sendQueue` field used for?
- The `_sendQueue` field is a `BlockingCollection` used to queue up actions to be executed by the `RunQueue` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `RegisterSatelliteProtocol` and `TryGetSatelliteProtocol` methods?
- These methods are placeholders and are not implemented. They are intended to allow registration and retrieval of satellite protocols for communication between peers.
