This file contains a C# class called `Extensions` that provides extension methods for other classes in the `Nethermind.Synchronization.ParallelSync` namespace. The purpose of this class is to provide additional functionality to these classes that is not present in their original implementation.

The first method in this class is called `GetSyncMode` and is an extension method for the `FastBlocksState` class. This method takes a boolean parameter called `isFullSync` and returns a `SyncMode` enum value. The purpose of this method is to determine the appropriate synchronization mode based on the current state of the `FastBlocksState` object and whether or not a full sync is being performed. The `SyncMode` enum represents the different synchronization modes that can be used during synchronization, such as `FastHeaders`, `FastBodies`, and `FastReceipts`.

The second method in this class is called `IsFastBlocksFinished` and is an extension method for the `ISyncProgressResolver` interface. This method returns a new instance of an inner class called `FastBlocksFinishedState`. The purpose of this method is to provide a way to check if the fast blocks synchronization process has finished. The `ISyncProgressResolver` interface provides methods for checking the progress of the synchronization process, and the `FastBlocksFinishedState` class uses these methods to determine if the fast blocks synchronization process has finished.

The `FastBlocksFinishedState` class has a constructor that takes an `ISyncProgressResolver` object and stores it in a private field. This class also has a method called `Returns` that takes a `FastBlocksState` enum value and sets the return values of the `IsFastBlocksHeadersFinished`, `IsFastBlocksBodiesFinished`, and `IsFastBlocksReceiptsFinished` methods of the `ISyncProgressResolver` object based on the value of the `FastBlocksState` enum. The purpose of this method is to provide a way to set the return values of these methods for testing purposes.

Overall, the `Extensions` class provides additional functionality to the `FastBlocksState` and `ISyncProgressResolver` classes/interfaces that is useful for the synchronization process in the larger `Nethermind` project. The `GetSyncMode` method helps determine the appropriate synchronization mode based on the current state of the `FastBlocksState` object, while the `IsFastBlocksFinished` method provides a way to check if the fast blocks synchronization process has finished. The `FastBlocksFinishedState` class provides a way to set the return values of the `ISyncProgressResolver` methods for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FastBlocksFinishedState` class?
- The `FastBlocksFinishedState` class is used to set up the return values for the `IsFastBlocksHeadersFinished()`, `IsFastBlocksBodiesFinished()`, and `IsFastBlocksReceiptsFinished()` methods of an `ISyncProgressResolver` object.

2. What is the significance of the `SyncMode` enum?
- The `SyncMode` enum is used to specify the synchronization mode for a `FastBlocksState` object, which can be either `FastHeaders`, `FastBodies`, `FastReceipts`, or `None`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetSyncMode` extension method?
- The `GetSyncMode` extension method is used to return the synchronization mode for a `FastBlocksState` object based on its current state and whether it is a full sync or not.
