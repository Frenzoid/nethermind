The `PeerInfoTests` class is a collection of unit tests for the `PeerInfo` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `PeerInfo` class is responsible for managing the state of a synchronization peer, including whether it is asleep, allocated, or can be allocated for a specific context. 

The tests cover various scenarios, including putting a peer to sleep, waking it up, allocating and freeing contexts, and checking whether a subcontext can be allocated. The tests use the `FluentAssertions` library to assert the expected behavior of the `PeerInfo` class.

The `TestFixture` attribute is used to specify the allocation context for each test. The `Parallelizable` attribute is used to indicate that the tests can be run in parallel.

The `Can_put_to_sleep_by_contexts` test checks whether a peer can be put to sleep by increasing its weakness for a specific context. The test increases the peer's weakness until it reaches the sleep threshold, at which point it should be put to sleep. The test then checks whether the peer is asleep for the specified context.

The `Can_put_to_sleep` test is similar to the previous test, but it puts the peer to sleep for all contexts. The test then checks whether the peer is asleep for all contexts.

The `Can_wake_up` test checks whether a peer can be woken up after being put to sleep. The test puts the peer to sleep and then tries to wake it up. The test then checks whether the peer is awake.

The `Can_fail_to_wake_up` test checks whether a peer can fail to wake up if the wake-up time is too short. The test puts the peer to sleep and then tries to wake it up after a short time. The test then checks whether the peer is still asleep and cannot be allocated.

The `Can_allocate` test checks whether a peer can be allocated for a specific context. The test tries to allocate the peer for a context and then checks whether it is allocated.

The `Can_free` test checks whether a peer can be freed after being allocated. The test allocates the peer for a context, frees it, and then checks whether it is no longer allocated.

The `Cannot_allocate_subcontext` test checks whether a peer can be allocated for a subcontext if it has already been allocated for a parent context. The test allocates the peer for a parent context and then checks whether it can be allocated for a subcontext. The test then frees the subcontext and checks whether the parent context is still allocated.

The `Cannot_allocate_subcontext_of_sleeping` test checks whether a peer can be allocated for a subcontext if it is already asleep for the parent context. The test puts the peer to sleep for the parent context and then checks whether it can be allocated for the subcontext.

Overall, these tests ensure that the `PeerInfo` class behaves correctly in various scenarios and that it can manage the state of a synchronization peer effectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerInfo` class?
- The `PeerInfo` class is used to manage the allocation and sleep state of a synchronization peer.

2. What is the significance of the `AllocationContexts` enum?
- The `AllocationContexts` enum is used to specify the different types of synchronization data that can be allocated to a peer, such as blocks, receipts, headers, etc.

3. What is the purpose of the `Can_fail_to_wake_up` test?
- The `Can_fail_to_wake_up` test checks that a sleeping peer cannot be woken up if the current time plus a specified delay is greater than the peer's sleep end time plus a specified tolerance.
