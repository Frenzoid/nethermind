The `SyncReportTest` class is a test suite for the `SyncReport` class in the Nethermind project. The `SyncReport` class is responsible for reporting synchronization progress to the user. The `SyncReportTest` class tests the `SyncReport` class by simulating synchronization progress and verifying that the progress is reported correctly.

The `SyncReportTest` class contains two test methods: `Smoke` and `Ancient_bodies_and_receipts_are_reported_correctly`. The `Smoke` method tests the basic functionality of the `SyncReport` class by simulating synchronization progress and verifying that the progress is reported correctly. The `Ancient_bodies_and_receipts_are_reported_correctly` method tests the reporting of ancient block bodies and receipts by the `SyncReport` class.

The `Smoke` method simulates synchronization progress by creating a `SyncReport` object and calling its methods to mark the end of synchronization stages. The `SyncReport` object is created with a `SyncConfig` object that specifies whether fast sync and fast blocks are enabled. The `SyncReport` object is also created with a `ISyncPeerPool` object, a `ISyncModeSelector` object, a `INodeStatsManager` object, a `IPivot` object, a `ILogManager` object, and a `ITimerFactory` object. These objects are all mocked using the `NSubstitute` library.

The `Ancient_bodies_and_receipts_are_reported_correctly` method tests the reporting of ancient block bodies and receipts by the `SyncReport` class. The method simulates synchronization progress by creating a `SyncReport` object and calling its methods to mark the end of synchronization stages. The `SyncReport` object is created with a `SyncConfig` object that specifies whether fast sync and fast blocks are enabled, and whether ancient bodies and receipts barriers are set. The `SyncReport` object is also created with a `ISyncPeerPool` object, a `ISyncModeSelector` object, a `INodeStatsManager` object, a `IPivot` object, a `ILogManager` object, and a `ITimerFactory` object. These objects are all mocked using the `NSubstitute` library.

In summary, the `SyncReportTest` class tests the `SyncReport` class by simulating synchronization progress and verifying that the progress is reported correctly. The `SyncReport` class is responsible for reporting synchronization progress to the user. The `SyncReport` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide feedback to the user during synchronization.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncReport` class?
- The `SyncReport` class is used to report synchronization progress and statistics for a node.

2. What is the significance of the `SyncModeSelector` and `SyncPeerPool` interfaces?
- The `SyncModeSelector` interface is used to select the current synchronization mode for a node, while the `SyncPeerPool` interface is used to manage the pool of peers that a node can synchronize with.

3. What is the purpose of the `AncientBodiesBarrier` and `AncientReceiptsBarrier` properties in the `SyncConfig` class?
- The `AncientBodiesBarrier` and `AncientReceiptsBarrier` properties are used to set the block numbers at which ancient block bodies and receipts should be downloaded during fast sync.
