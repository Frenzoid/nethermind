The `SyncDbTunerTests` class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the `SyncDbTuner` class. The `SyncDbTuner` class is responsible for tuning the database based on the synchronization mode. The class takes in several parameters, including the synchronization configuration, synchronization feeds, and the database instances. The class has several methods that are responsible for tuning the database based on the synchronization mode.

The `Setup` method initializes the test environment by creating instances of the required classes and setting up the test environment. The `TestFeedAndDbTune` method is a helper method that tests the synchronization feed and the database tuning. The method takes in two parameters, the synchronization feed, and the database instance. The method tests the synchronization feed by raising an event with the `SyncFeedStateEventArgs` class. The method then tests the database tuning by verifying that the `Tune` method of the database instance was called with the correct synchronization mode.

The `WhenSnapIsOn_TriggerStateDbTune` method tests the `SyncDbTuner` class's ability to tune the state database when the snap synchronization mode is on. The method calls the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method with the snap synchronization feed and the state database instance.

The `WhenSnapIsOn_TriggerCodeDbTune` method tests the `SyncDbTuner` class's ability to tune the code database when the snap synchronization mode is on. The method calls the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method with the snap synchronization feed and the code database instance.

The `WhenBodiesIsOn_TriggerBlocksDbTune` method tests the `SyncDbTuner` class's ability to tune the block database when the bodies synchronization mode is on. The method calls the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method with the bodies synchronization feed and the block database instance.

The `WhenReceiptsIsOn_TriggerReceiptsDbTune` method tests the `SyncDbTuner` class's ability to tune the receipts database when the receipts synchronization mode is on. The method calls the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method with the receipts synchronization feed and the receipts database instance.

Overall, the `SyncDbTuner` class is an essential class in the Nethermind project as it is responsible for tuning the database based on the synchronization mode. The unit tests in the `SyncDbTunerTests` class ensure that the `SyncDbTuner` class is functioning correctly and that the database is being tuned correctly based on the synchronization mode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a test file for the `SyncDbTuner` class in the `Nethermind.Synchronization.DbTuner` namespace, which tests the behavior of the class when different types of synchronization feeds are active.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `Nethermind` project, including `SyncConfig`, `ISyncFeed`, and `ITunableDb`. It also uses `NSubstitute` and `NUnit.Framework` for testing.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `TestFeedAndDbTune` method?
   - The `TestFeedAndDbTune` method is expected to trigger a database tuning operation on the provided `ITunableDb` object when the provided `ISyncFeed` object changes to an active state, and then trigger another tuning operation with a different tuning type when the feed changes to a finished state.
