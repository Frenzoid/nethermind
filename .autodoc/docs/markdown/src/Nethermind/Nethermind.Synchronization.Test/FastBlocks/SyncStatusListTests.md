The `SyncStatusListTests` class is a test suite for the `FastBlockStatusList` class in the `Nethermind.Synchronization.FastBlocks` namespace. The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `FastBlockStatusList` class behaves correctly in various scenarios.

The `Out_of_range_access_throws` test method tests whether the `FastBlockStatusList` class throws an `IndexOutOfRangeException` when an out-of-range index is accessed. It creates a new `FastBlockStatusList` object with a capacity of 1, and then attempts to access indices -1 and 1, which should both throw an exception. It also tests whether the `FastBlockStatusList` class throws an exception when an out-of-range index is assigned a value. This test ensures that the `FastBlockStatusList` class correctly handles invalid index values.

The `Can_read_back_all_set_values` test method tests whether the `FastBlockStatusList` class correctly stores and retrieves values. It creates a new `FastBlockStatusList` object with a capacity of 500, and then assigns each element a value of `FastBlockStatus.Unknown`, `FastBlockStatus.FastSynced`, or `FastBlockStatus.NotFastSynced`, depending on the index modulo 3. It then checks whether each element has the expected value. This test ensures that the `FastBlockStatusList` class correctly stores and retrieves values.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the `FastBlockStatusList` class behaves correctly in various scenarios, which is important for the correct functioning of the larger project. By testing the `FastBlockStatusList` class, the test suite helps to ensure that the synchronization of fast blocks works as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncStatusListTests` class?
- The `SyncStatusListTests` class is a test fixture for testing the `FastBlockStatusList` class.

2. What is the difference between the two test methods `Out_of_range_access_throws` and `Can_read_back_all_set_values`?
- The `Out_of_range_access_throws` method tests whether an index out of range exception is thrown when trying to access an element outside the bounds of the `FastBlockStatusList`. The `Can_read_back_all_set_values` method tests whether all set values can be read back correctly.

3. What is the purpose of the `FastBlockStatusList` class?
- The `FastBlockStatusList` class is used to store a list of `FastBlockStatus` values, which are used to represent the synchronization status of fast blocks.
