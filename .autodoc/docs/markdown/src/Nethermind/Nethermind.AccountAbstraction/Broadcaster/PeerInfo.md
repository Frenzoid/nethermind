The `PeerInfo` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used in the Account Abstraction module. The purpose of this class is to provide a wrapper around a `IUserOperationPoolPeer` object and add functionality to track and manage user operations that have been notified to the peer.

The `PeerInfo` class implements the `IUserOperationPoolPeer` interface, which defines methods for sending new user operations to a peer. The `PeerInfo` class has a private `IUserOperationPoolPeer` object called `Peer`, which is used to delegate the actual sending of user operations to the wrapped peer.

The `PeerInfo` class also has a private `LruKeyCache<Keccak>` object called `NotifiedUserOperations`, which is used to keep track of user operations that have been notified to the peer. The `LruKeyCache` is a cache that stores a fixed number of items and removes the least recently used items when the cache is full. In this case, the cache is used to store the request IDs of user operations that have been notified to the peer.

The `PeerInfo` class has three public methods: `SendNewUserOperation`, `SendNewUserOperations`, and `ToString`. The `SendNewUserOperation` method takes a `UserOperationWithEntryPoint` object and sends it to the wrapped peer if the request ID of the user operation has not already been notified to the peer. The `SendNewUserOperations` method takes an enumerable collection of `UserOperationWithEntryPoint` objects and sends only the user operations that have not already been notified to the peer. The `ToString` method returns the `Enode` property of the wrapped peer as a string.

The `PeerInfo` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to manage the sending of user operations to peers in the network. By wrapping a `IUserOperationPoolPeer` object, the `PeerInfo` class can add functionality to track and manage user operations that have been notified to the peer. This can help to prevent duplicate user operations from being sent to a peer, which can improve the efficiency and reliability of the network. 

Example usage:

```
IUserOperationPoolPeer peer = new UserOperationPoolPeer();
PeerInfo peerInfo = new PeerInfo(peer);

UserOperationWithEntryPoint uop = new UserOperationWithEntryPoint();
uop.UserOperation.RequestId = "12345";

peerInfo.SendNewUserOperation(uop);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerInfo` class?
    
    The `PeerInfo` class is used for broadcasting user operations to a peer in the network.

2. What is the `NotifiedUserOperations` cache used for?
    
    The `NotifiedUserOperations` cache is used to keep track of user operations that have already been sent to a peer, so that they are not sent again.

3. What is the significance of the `TODO` comment in the code?
    
    The `TODO` comment indicates that there is a task that needs to be completed, which is to check whether the `NotifiedUserOperations` cache will support a certain form.
