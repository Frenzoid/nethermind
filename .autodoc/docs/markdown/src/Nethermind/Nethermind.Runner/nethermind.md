This code defines a set of CSS variables that can be used throughout the nethermind project to maintain a consistent visual style. 

The `:root` selector is used to define the variables at the highest level of the document tree, making them available to all elements within the project. 

The `--primaryColor` variable is set to a light gray color, while `--secondaryColor` is set to a bright orange. These colors can be used to create a visual hierarchy within the project, with the primary color being used for less important elements and the secondary color being used for more important elements. 

The `--bgMenuActive` variable is set to a bright blue color, which can be used to indicate when a menu item is currently active. 

The `--bgButton` variable is set to the same bright orange color as `--secondaryColor`, which can be used to create a consistent style for buttons throughout the project. 

The `--logoImageUrl` variable is set to the URL of the nethermind project's logo image, which can be used to display the logo throughout the project. 

Finally, the `--bgAside` variable is set to the same light gray color as `--primaryColor`, which can be used to create a consistent background color for sidebars or other secondary content areas throughout the project. 

Overall, this code helps to maintain a consistent visual style throughout the nethermind project by defining a set of reusable CSS variables. These variables can be used in conjunction with other CSS styles to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. 

Example usage:

```css
.navbar {
  background-color: var(--primaryColor);
}

.active-menu-item {
  background-color: var(--bgMenuActive);
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--bgButton);
  color: white;
}

.logo {
  background-image: var(--logoImageUrl);
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: var(--bgAside);
}
```
