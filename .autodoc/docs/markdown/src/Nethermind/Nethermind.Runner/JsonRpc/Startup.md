The `Startup` class in the `Nethermind.Runner.JsonRpc` namespace is responsible for configuring and starting the JSON-RPC server. The `ConfigureServices` method sets up the necessary services for the application, including configuring the Kestrel server options, registering JSON-RPC services, adding controllers, and enabling response compression. The `Configure` method sets up the middleware pipeline for the application, including handling HTTP requests, enabling CORS, and handling WebSocket requests if enabled. 

The `Configure` method also handles incoming JSON-RPC requests by processing them asynchronously using the `IJsonRpcProcessor` service. The response is then serialized and sent back to the client. The method also handles authentication and authorization of requests, and supports both HTTP and WebSocket requests. 

The `Startup` class is a key component of the Nethermind project, as it is responsible for starting the JSON-RPC server and handling incoming requests. Developers can use this class as a starting point for building their own JSON-RPC servers, or modify it to suit their specific needs. 

Example usage:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        })
        .Build();

    host.Run();
}
```
