## `launchSettings.json`

The `launchSettings.json` file in the `Nethermind.Runner/Properties` folder defines a set of profiles for the nethermind project. Each profile specifies a set of command line arguments and environment variables to be used when running the nethermind application. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to run the nethermind application with different configurations depending on the use case.

The `launchSettings.json` file is used by the `dotnet run` command to run the nethermind application with the specified profile. For example, to run the nethermind application with the "Chiado" profile, the following command can be used:

```
dotnet run --launch-profile Chiado
```

This command will run the nethermind application with the "Chiado" profile, which will use the command line arguments and environment variables specified in the profile.

The `launchSettings.json` file is an important part of the nethermind project as it allows developers to quickly switch between different configurations of the nethermind application without having to manually specify the command line arguments and environment variables each time. This can save a lot of time and effort, especially when working with multiple configurations.

Here is an example of how to define a profile in the `launchSettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "Chiado": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "NETH_CONFIG": "chiado",
        "NETH_DIAGNOSTICS": "true"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the "Chiado" profile is defined with the `NETH_CONFIG` environment variable set to "chiado" and the `NETH_DIAGNOSTICS` environment variable set to "true". The `applicationUrl` property specifies the URL that the nethermind application should listen on.

Overall, the `launchSettings.json` file is a useful tool for developers working on the nethermind project as it allows them to quickly switch between different configurations of the nethermind application.
