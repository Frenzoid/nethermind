The `MemoryAllowance` class in the `Nethermind.Trie` namespace is responsible for managing the memory allowance for the trie node cache in the Nethermind project. The trie node cache is a data structure used to store trie nodes in memory for faster access and retrieval. 

The `MemoryAllowance` class contains two properties: `TrieNodeCacheMemory` and `TrieNodeCacheCount`. The `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property is a long integer that represents the amount of memory allocated for the trie node cache. By default, it is set to 128 megabytes using the `128.MB()` extension method from the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace. This value can be changed at runtime to adjust the memory allowance for the trie node cache.

The `TrieNodeCacheCount` property is an integer that represents the maximum number of trie nodes that can be stored in the trie node cache based on the allocated memory. It is calculated by dividing the `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property by the average memory estimate of a single trie node, which is defined in the `PatriciaTree.OneNodeAvgMemoryEstimate` constant. 

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to manage the memory allocation for the trie node cache. Developers can adjust the memory allowance for the trie node cache by changing the value of the `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property. The `TrieNodeCacheCount` property can be used to determine the maximum number of trie nodes that can be stored in the trie node cache based on the allocated memory. 

Example usage:

```csharp
// Set the memory allowance for the trie node cache to 256 megabytes
MemoryAllowance.TrieNodeCacheMemory = 256.MB();

// Get the maximum number of trie nodes that can be stored in the trie node cache
int maxNodeCount = MemoryAllowance.TrieNodeCacheCount;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemoryAllowance` class?
- The `MemoryAllowance` class is used to manage memory allocation for the trie data structure.

2. What is the significance of the `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property?
- The `TrieNodeCacheMemory` property sets the amount of memory allocated for the trie node cache, with a default value of 128 megabytes.

3. What is the purpose of the `TrieNodeCacheCount` property?
- The `TrieNodeCacheCount` property calculates the maximum number of trie nodes that can be stored in the cache based on the allocated memory and the average memory estimate for a single node.
