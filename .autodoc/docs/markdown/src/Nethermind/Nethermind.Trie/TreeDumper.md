The `TreeDumper` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to traverse and dump the contents of a Merkle Patricia Trie. The class implements the `ITreeVisitor` interface, which defines the methods that are called when traversing the trie. The `TreeDumper` class provides an implementation for each of these methods.

The `Reset` method is used to clear the internal `StringBuilder` object that is used to accumulate the output of the dump. The `IsFullDbScan` property returns `true`, indicating that a full database scan is required to traverse the trie. The `ShouldVisit` method always returns `true`, indicating that all nodes in the trie should be visited.

The `VisitTree` method is called when the root node of the trie is visited. It checks if the root hash is equal to the empty tree hash, and if so, appends the string "EMPTY TREE" to the output. Otherwise, it appends either "STORAGE TREE" or "STATE TREE" to the output, depending on the value of the `IsStorage` property of the `TrieVisitContext` object.

The `VisitMissingNode` method is called when a node is missing from the trie. It appends a line to the output indicating the hash of the missing node.

The `VisitBranch` method is called when a branch node is visited. It appends a line to the output indicating the hash of the node, along with the index of the child node that is being visited.

The `VisitExtension` method is called when an extension node is visited. It appends a line to the output indicating the hash of the node, along with the key that the extension node represents.

The `VisitLeaf` method is called when a leaf node is visited. It appends a line to the output indicating the hash of the node, along with the key that the leaf node represents. If the `TrieVisitContext` object indicates that the node is a storage node, the value of the node is also appended to the output. If the node is an account node, the `Account` object that is represented by the node is decoded and its nonce, balance, and contract status are appended to the output.

The `VisitCode` method is called when the code for a contract is visited. It appends a line to the output indicating the hash of the code.

The `ToString` method returns the accumulated output as a string.

Overall, the `TreeDumper` class provides a way to traverse and dump the contents of a Merkle Patricia Trie, which is used to store the state and storage of the Ethereum blockchain. This class can be used to debug issues related to the trie, or to extract information from the trie for analysis purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TreeDumper` class?
    
    The `TreeDumper` class is used to visit and dump the contents of a Merkle Patricia Trie.

2. What is the difference between a "STATE TREE" and a "STORAGE TREE"?
    
    A "STATE TREE" represents the state of the Ethereum blockchain, while a "STORAGE TREE" represents the storage of a smart contract.

3. What is the purpose of the `VisitMissingNode` method?
    
    The `VisitMissingNode` method is called when a node is missing from the trie, and it is used to log the missing node's hash and location in the trie.
