The code above defines a class called `MemoryLimit` that implements the `IPruningStrategy` interface. This class is used in the larger `nethermind` project to manage memory usage during trie pruning. Trie pruning is a process of removing unnecessary nodes from a trie data structure to reduce its size and improve performance.

The `MemoryLimit` class takes a `long` value as a parameter in its constructor, which represents the maximum amount of memory that can be used during trie pruning. The class has two methods: `PruningEnabled` and `ShouldPrune`. 

The `PruningEnabled` method returns a boolean value indicating whether pruning is enabled or not. In this case, it always returns `true`.

The `ShouldPrune` method takes a `long` value as a parameter, which represents the current memory usage during trie pruning. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether pruning should be performed or not. If `PruningEnabled` is `true` and the current memory usage is greater than or equal to the memory limit specified in the constructor, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to display the memory limit in megabytes when debugging the code.

Here is an example of how the `MemoryLimit` class can be used in the larger `nethermind` project:

```
long memoryLimit = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB
IPruningStrategy pruningStrategy = new MemoryLimit(memoryLimit);
Trie trie = new Trie(pruningStrategy);
```

In this example, a `MemoryLimit` instance is created with a memory limit of 100MB. This instance is then passed to the `Trie` constructor as a pruning strategy. The `Trie` class uses the pruning strategy to manage memory usage during trie pruning.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a class called `MemoryLimit` which implements the `IPruningStrategy` interface for pruning trie nodes in the Nethermind project.

2. What is the significance of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute used in this code?
   - The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute is used to specify how the object of the `MemoryLimit` class should be displayed in the debugger window. In this case, it displays the memory limit in megabytes.

3. What is the role of the `ShouldPrune` method in this code?
   - The `ShouldPrune` method is used to determine whether trie nodes should be pruned based on the current memory usage and the memory limit specified in the constructor of the `MemoryLimit` class. It returns `true` if pruning is enabled and the current memory usage is greater than or equal to the memory limit.
