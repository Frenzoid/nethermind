This code defines an extension method for the `ITrieStore` interface in the `Nethermind.Trie.Pruning` namespace. The purpose of this extension method is to provide a way to create a read-only version of a `ITrieStore` instance.

The `AsReadOnly` method takes an `ITrieStore` instance as its first argument and an optional `IKeyValueStore` instance as its second argument. The `ITrieStore` instance is the one that will be converted to a read-only version, while the `IKeyValueStore` instance is used to store the read-only version of the trie. If the `IKeyValueStore` instance is not provided, a default one will be used.

The `AsReadOnly` method returns an `IReadOnlyTrieStore` instance, which is a read-only version of the original `ITrieStore` instance. This read-only version can be used to retrieve data from the trie, but it cannot be modified.

This extension method can be useful in situations where you want to provide read-only access to a trie, but you don't want to expose the original `ITrieStore` instance. For example, you might want to provide read-only access to a trie to a client application, but you don't want the client to be able to modify the trie.

Here is an example of how to use the `AsReadOnly` extension method:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Trie.Pruning;

// create an instance of ITrieStore
ITrieStore trieStore = new MyTrieStore();

// create a read-only version of the trie store
IReadOnlyTrieStore readOnlyTrieStore = trieStore.AsReadOnly();

// use the read-only version of the trie store to retrieve data
byte[] value = readOnlyTrieStore.Get("key");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    - This code file contains an extension method for `ITrieStore` interface to convert it to a read-only version.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
    - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, it is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. Why is the `IKeyValueStore` parameter nullable in the `AsReadOnly` method?
    - The `IKeyValueStore` parameter is nullable in the `AsReadOnly` method to allow for the possibility of not providing a read-only store. If no read-only store is provided, the method will create a new one.
