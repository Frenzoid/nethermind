The code above defines a class called `ReorgBoundaryReached` that is used to signal when a certain block number has been reached and is safe to mark as a checkpoint. This class is part of the `Nethermind` project and is located in the `Trie.Pruning` namespace.

The `ReorgBoundaryReached` class inherits from the `EventArgs` class, which is a base class for classes that contain event data. The `ReorgBoundaryReached` class has a constructor that takes a `long` parameter called `blockNumber`. This parameter represents the block number that has been reached and is safe to mark as a checkpoint. The `BlockNumber` property is a read-only property that returns the `blockNumber` parameter.

This class is used to signal when a certain block number has been reached and is safe to mark as a checkpoint. A checkpoint is a point in the blockchain where the state of the system is saved. This is done to ensure that the system can recover from a failure or attack. By marking a certain block number as a checkpoint, the system can recover from a failure or attack by starting from that block number and rebuilding the state of the system from there.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger `Nethermind` project:

```csharp
using Nethermind.Trie.Pruning;

public class CheckpointManager
{
    public event EventHandler<ReorgBoundaryReached> ReorgBoundaryReached;

    public void OnReorgBoundaryReached(long blockNumber)
    {
        ReorgBoundaryReached?.Invoke(this, new ReorgBoundaryReached(blockNumber));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CheckpointManager` class defines an event called `ReorgBoundaryReached` that is raised when a certain block number has been reached and is safe to mark as a checkpoint. The `OnReorgBoundaryReached` method is called when the block number is reached and raises the `ReorgBoundaryReached` event with the `blockNumber` parameter. Other parts of the `Nethermind` project can subscribe to this event and take appropriate action when the block number is reached.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a class called `ReorgBoundaryReached` which is used to determine which number is safe to mark as a checkpoint if it was persisted before.

2. What is the significance of the `SPDX` comments at the top of the file?
   - The `SPDX` comments indicate the copyright holder and license information for the code.

3. How is the `ReorgBoundaryReached` class used in the overall `nethermind` project?
   - Without further context, it is unclear how the `ReorgBoundaryReached` class is used in the `nethermind` project.
