The code defines a static class called Metrics that contains a set of properties that are decorated with custom attributes. These properties are used to track various metrics related to the Trie pruning process in the Nethermind project. 

The Metrics class contains properties that track the number of nodes that are currently kept in cache, the number of nodes that have been persisted since the session start, and the number of nodes that have been committed since the session start. These properties are decorated with the GaugeMetric attribute, which indicates that they represent a value that can go up or down over time.

The class also contains properties that track the number of nodes that have been removed from the cache during pruning because they have been persisted before, the number of nodes that have been removed from the cache during deep pruning because they have been persisted before, and the number of nodes that have been removed from the cache during pruning because they were no longer needed. These properties are decorated with the CounterMetric attribute, which indicates that they represent a value that only goes up over time.

In addition, the Metrics class contains properties that track the number of DB reads, the number of reads from the node cache, and the number of reads from the RLP cache. These properties are also decorated with the CounterMetric attribute.

The class also contains properties that track the time taken by the last snapshot persistence, the time taken by the last pruning, and the time taken by the last deep pruning. These properties are decorated with the GaugeMetric attribute.

Finally, the class contains properties that track the last persisted block number (snapshot) and the estimated memory used by the cache. These properties are also decorated with the GaugeMetric attribute.

Overall, the Metrics class provides a way to track various metrics related to the Trie pruning process in the Nethermind project. These metrics can be used to monitor the performance of the pruning process and to identify areas for optimization. For example, if the number of nodes being removed from the cache during pruning is high, this may indicate that the pruning algorithm needs to be optimized to reduce the number of unnecessary node removals. 

Example usage:
```
Metrics.CachedNodesCount = 1000;
Metrics.PersistedNodeCount = 500;
Metrics.CommittedNodesCount = 750;
Metrics.PrunedPersistedNodesCount = 100;
Metrics.DeepPrunedPersistedNodesCount = 50;
Metrics.PrunedTransientNodesCount = 200;
Metrics.LoadedFromDbNodesCount = 1000;
Metrics.LoadedFromCacheNodesCount = 500;
Metrics.LoadedFromRlpCacheNodesCount = 250;
Metrics.ReplacedNodesCount = 50;
Metrics.SnapshotPersistenceTime = 1000;
Metrics.PruningTime = 500;
Metrics.DeepPruningTime = 750;
Metrics.LastPersistedBlockNumber = 10000;
Metrics.MemoryUsedByCache = 1024;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Metrics` class?
    
    The `Metrics` class is a static class that contains properties with metrics related to node caching and pruning in the Nethermind Trie implementation.

2. What is the significance of the `GaugeMetric` and `CounterMetric` attributes used in this code?
    
    The `GaugeMetric` and `CounterMetric` attributes are used to mark the properties as metrics that should be tracked by the Nethermind monitoring system. `GaugeMetric` properties represent a value that can go up or down, while `CounterMetric` properties represent a value that only goes up.

3. What is the relationship between the `CachedNodesCount` and `PersistedNodeCount` properties?
    
    The `CachedNodesCount` property represents the number of nodes that are currently kept in cache (either persisted or not), while the `PersistedNodeCount` property represents the number of nodes that have been persisted since the session start. Therefore, the `PersistedNodeCount` property is a subset of the `CachedNodesCount` property.
