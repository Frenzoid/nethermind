The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class is a part of the Nethermind blockchain project and provides information about the current state of the blockchain. It implements the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface and has three constructors that take different combinations of `ISpecProvider`, `IBlockTree`, and `IAccountStateProvider` objects as parameters.

The `SpecProvider` property is of type `IChainHeadSpecProvider` and is used to provide information about the current state of the blockchain. The `AccountStateProvider` property is of type `IAccountStateProvider` and is used to provide information about the current state of the accounts in the blockchain.

The `BlockGasLimit` property is of type `long?` and is used to store the current gas limit of the latest block in the blockchain. The `CurrentBaseFee` property is of type `UInt256` and is used to store the current base fee per gas of the latest block in the blockchain.

The `HeadChanged` event is raised whenever a new block is added to the blockchain. The `OnHeadChanged` method is called when this event is raised and updates the `BlockGasLimit` and `CurrentBaseFee` properties with the values from the latest block. It also raises the `HeadChanged` event with the sender and event arguments.

This class can be used to get information about the current state of the blockchain, such as the current gas limit and base fee per gas. It can also be used to subscribe to the `HeadChanged` event to get notified whenever a new block is added to the blockchain.

Example usage:

```csharp
// create a new instance of ChainHeadInfoProvider
var chainHeadInfoProvider = new ChainHeadInfoProvider(specProvider, blockTree, stateReader);

// get the current gas limit
var currentGasLimit = chainHeadInfoProvider.BlockGasLimit;

// subscribe to the HeadChanged event
chainHeadInfoProvider.HeadChanged += (sender, e) =>
{
    // handle the event
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class?
    
    The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` class is an implementation of the `IChainHeadInfoProvider` interface and provides information about the current chain head, including the gas limit and current base fee.

2. What are the parameters of the `ChainHeadInfoProvider` constructor?
    
    The `ChainHeadInfoProvider` constructor takes an `ISpecProvider` object, an `IBlockTree` object, and an `IAccountStateProvider` object as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `OnHeadChanged` method?
    
    The `OnHeadChanged` method is an event handler that is called when a new block is added to the main chain. It updates the `BlockGasLimit` and `CurrentBaseFee` properties and invokes the `HeadChanged` event.
