The `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class is a wrapper around an `IBlockTree` instance that provides read-only access to the blockchain data. It implements the `IReadOnlyBlockTree` interface, which defines a set of read-only properties and methods for accessing blockchain data. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a safe and efficient way to read blockchain data without the risk of accidentally modifying it. It is designed to be used by classes that need to read blockchain data but do not need to modify it. 

The `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class provides read-only access to various properties of the wrapped `IBlockTree` instance, such as the network ID, chain ID, genesis block, and best suggested block. It also provides read-only access to various methods for finding and retrieving blockchain data, such as `FindBlock`, `FindHeader`, and `FindHash`. 

The class also provides a number of read-only events that can be used to monitor changes to the blockchain data, such as `NewBestSuggestedBlock`, `NewSuggestedBlock`, `BlockAddedToMain`, and `NewHeadBlock`. 

One important feature of the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class is that it is safe to be reused for all classes reading the same wrapped block tree. This means that multiple instances of the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class can be created and used by different classes without any risk of data corruption or inconsistency. 

Overall, the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class is an important component of the Nethermind blockchain project, providing a safe and efficient way to read blockchain data. It is designed to be used by classes that need read-only access to the blockchain data, and provides a number of useful read-only properties and methods for accessing and retrieving blockchain data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class?
- The `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class is a wrapper around an `IBlockTree` instance that provides read-only access to the blockchain data.

2. What methods or properties of the `IBlockTree` interface are exposed by the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class?
- The `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class exposes several properties of the `IBlockTree` interface, such as `NetworkId`, `ChainId`, `Genesis`, `BestSuggestedHeader`, `BestSuggestedBeaconHeader`, `LowestInsertedHeader`, `LowestInsertedBodyNumber`, `BestPersistedState`, `LowestInsertedBeaconHeader`, `BestSuggestedBody`, `BestKnownNumber`, `BestKnownBeaconNumber`, `Head`, `HeadHash`, `GenesisHash`, `PendingHash`, `FinalizedHash`, and `SafeHash`. It also exposes several methods of the `IBlockTree` interface, such as `GetInfo`, `FindLevel`, `FindCanonicalBlockInfo`, `Insert`, `SuggestBlock`, `SuggestBlockAsync`, `SuggestHeader`, `FindBlock`, `FindHeader`, `FindHash`, `FindHeaders`, `FindLowestCommonAncestor`, `IsMainChain`, `IsKnownBlock`, `IsKnownBeaconBlock`, `WasProcessed`, `LoadLowestInsertedBeaconHeader`, `IsBetterThanHead`, `UpdateBeaconMainChain`, `UpdateMainChain`, and `ForkChoiceUpdated`.

3. What is the purpose of the `DeleteChainSlice` method and what are its limitations?
- The `DeleteChainSlice` method is used to delete a range of blocks from the blockchain, starting from a specified block number and ending at an optional end block number. However, the `ReadOnlyBlockTree` class does not allow the deletion of blocks, so calling this method will always result in an `InvalidOperationException`.
