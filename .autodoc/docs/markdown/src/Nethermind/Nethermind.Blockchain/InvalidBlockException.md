This code defines a custom exception class called `InvalidBlockException` that inherits from the `BlockchainException` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to handle exceptions that occur when an invalid block is encountered in the blockchain.

The `InvalidBlockException` class takes a `Block` object and an optional `Exception` object as parameters in its constructor. The `Block` object represents the invalid block that caused the exception to be thrown, while the `Exception` object represents any inner exception that may have occurred.

The constructor of the `InvalidBlockException` class sets the message of the exception to a string that describes the invalid block. It also sets the `InvalidBlock` property of the exception to the `Block` object that was passed in as a parameter.

This exception class can be used in the larger project to handle any exceptions that occur when an invalid block is encountered in the blockchain. For example, if a block is found to be invalid during the validation process, an instance of the `InvalidBlockException` class can be thrown with the invalid block as a parameter. This allows the calling code to catch the exception and handle it appropriately, such as by logging the error or notifying the user.

Code example:

```
try
{
    // validate block
}
catch (InvalidBlockException ex)
{
    // handle invalid block exception
    Console.WriteLine($"Invalid block encountered: {ex.InvalidBlock}");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InvalidBlockException` class?
- The `InvalidBlockException` class is used to represent an exception that occurs when an invalid block is encountered in the blockchain.

2. What is the relationship between the `InvalidBlockException` class and the `BlockchainException` class?
- The `InvalidBlockException` class inherits from the `BlockchainException` class, which means that it is a type of exception that can be thrown by the blockchain.

3. What is the significance of the `Block` parameter in the constructor of the `InvalidBlockException` class?
- The `Block` parameter is used to specify the block that caused the exception to be thrown. This information can be useful for debugging and error reporting purposes.
