The `SyncConfig` class is a configuration class for synchronization modes in the Nethermind blockchain project. It provides a set of properties that can be used to configure the synchronization process. 

The class has several static properties that provide pre-configured instances of the `ISyncConfig` interface. These properties include `Default`, `WithFullSyncOnly`, `WithFastSync`, `WithFastBlocks`, and `WithEth2Merge`. These properties can be used to quickly configure the synchronization process without having to manually set each property.

The `SyncConfig` class has several properties that can be used to configure the synchronization process. These properties include `NetworkingEnabled`, `SynchronizationEnabled`, `FastSyncCatchUpHeightDelta`, `FastBlocks`, `UseGethLimitsInFastBlocks`, `FastSync`, `DownloadHeadersInFastSync`, `DownloadBodiesInFastSync`, `DownloadReceiptsInFastSync`, `AncientBodiesBarrier`, `AncientReceiptsBarrier`, `PivotTotalDifficulty`, `PivotNumber`, `PivotHash`, `WitnessProtocolEnabled`, `SnapSync`, `SnapSyncAccountRangePartitionCount`, `FixReceipts`, `FixTotalDifficulty`, `FixTotalDifficultyStartingBlock`, `FixTotalDifficultyLastBlock`, `StrictMode`, `BlockGossipEnabled`, `NonValidatorNode`, and `TuneDbMode`.

The `SyncConfig` class also overrides the `ToString()` method to provide a string representation of the configuration. This can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

Overall, the `SyncConfig` class provides a flexible and configurable way to set synchronization modes in the Nethermind blockchain project. Developers can use the pre-configured static properties or manually set the properties to customize the synchronization process to their needs.
