[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Blockchain/FullPruning/PruningTriggerEventArgs.cs)

The code defines a class called `PruningTriggerEventArgs` that inherits from the `EventArgs` class. This class is used to define an event argument that is passed to an event handler when a full pruning trigger occurs in the Nethermind blockchain. 

The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class has a single property called `Status` which is of type `PruningStatus`. This property is used to store the result of the full pruning trigger. The `PruningStatus` is an enumeration that defines the possible states of the full pruning trigger. 

This code is important in the larger Nethermind project because it allows developers to handle full pruning triggers in a standardized way. By defining a class that inherits from `EventArgs`, developers can create event handlers that can be registered to handle full pruning triggers. When a full pruning trigger occurs, the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` object is created and passed to the event handler. The event handler can then use the `Status` property to determine the result of the full pruning trigger and take appropriate action. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger Nethermind project:

```
public class MyBlockchainNode
{
    private Nethermind.Blockchain.FullPruning.Blockchain blockchain;

    public MyBlockchainNode()
    {
        blockchain = new Nethermind.Blockchain.FullPruning.Blockchain();
        blockchain.FullPruningTriggered += OnFullPruningTriggered;
    }

    private void OnFullPruningTriggered(object sender, PruningTriggerEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Status == PruningStatus.Success)
        {
            // Do something when full pruning is successful
        }
        else if (e.Status == PruningStatus.Failure)
        {
            // Do something when full pruning fails
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyBlockchainNode` class creates a new instance of the `Blockchain` class from the Nethermind project. It then registers an event handler for the `FullPruningTriggered` event of the `Blockchain` class. When a full pruning trigger occurs, the `OnFullPruningTriggered` method is called with a `PruningTriggerEventArgs` object. The method checks the `Status` property of the event args to determine if the full pruning was successful or not and takes appropriate action.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class?
   - The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class is used to define an event argument for triggering full pruning and contains a property for the result of the pruning operation.

2. What is the `PruningStatus` type?
   - The `PruningStatus` type is not defined in this code snippet, so a smart developer might wonder what it is and where it is defined. It is likely defined elsewhere in the `Nethermind` project.

3. What is the significance of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - The `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
