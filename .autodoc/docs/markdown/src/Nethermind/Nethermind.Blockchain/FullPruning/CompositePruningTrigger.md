The `CompositePruningTrigger` class is a part of the Nethermind blockchain project and is used to allow multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to monitor multiple triggers for pruning events and invoke the `Prune` event when any of the triggers are pruned.

The `CompositePruningTrigger` class implements the `IPruningTrigger` interface, which defines a `Prune` event that is raised when a pruning trigger is triggered. The `Add` method is used to add a new `IPruningTrigger` to the list of triggers that are being watched. When a pruning event is raised by any of the triggers, the `OnPrune` method is called, which in turn invokes the `Prune` event.

This class is useful in scenarios where multiple triggers need to be monitored for pruning events. For example, in a blockchain system, there may be multiple triggers that can cause pruning of old blocks, such as a change in consensus rules or a change in the block size limit. By using the `CompositePruningTrigger` class, all of these triggers can be monitored and handled in a single place.

Here is an example of how the `CompositePruningTrigger` class can be used:

```
var compositeTrigger = new CompositePruningTrigger();
var trigger1 = new ConsensusPruningTrigger();
var trigger2 = new BlockSizePruningTrigger();

compositeTrigger.Add(trigger1);
compositeTrigger.Add(trigger2);

compositeTrigger.Prune += (sender, args) =>
{
    // Handle pruning event
};
```

In this example, two triggers (`ConsensusPruningTrigger` and `BlockSizePruningTrigger`) are added to the `CompositePruningTrigger` instance. When either of these triggers is pruned, the `Prune` event of the `CompositePruningTrigger` is raised, which can be handled by the code that subscribes to the event.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `CompositePruningTrigger` that allows for multiple `IPruningTrigger`s to be watched.

2. What is the `IPruningTrigger` interface?
- The `IPruningTrigger` interface is not defined in this code, but it is referenced as a type that can be added to the `CompositePruningTrigger` class.

3. What is the `OnPrune` method used for?
- The `OnPrune` method is a private method that is called when a `Prune` event is triggered by one of the watched `IPruningTrigger`s. It then invokes the `Prune` event for the `CompositePruningTrigger` object.
