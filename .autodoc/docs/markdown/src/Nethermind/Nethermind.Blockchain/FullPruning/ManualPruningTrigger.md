The `ManualPruningTrigger` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to manually trigger full pruning. Full pruning is a process in which old and unnecessary data is removed from the blockchain to reduce its size and improve performance. This class implements the `IPruningTrigger` interface, which defines the contract for triggering pruning.

The class has a single public method called `Trigger()`, which triggers the full pruning process. When this method is called, it raises the `Prune` event, which is defined as a delegate in the `IPruningTrigger` interface. The `Prune` event is used to notify other parts of the system that pruning has been triggered. The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class is used to pass additional information about the pruning process, such as the status of the pruning operation.

The `ManualPruningTrigger` class is designed to be used in conjunction with other parts of the Nethermind project that implement the full pruning functionality. For example, it could be used in a user interface to allow users to manually trigger pruning. It could also be used in an automated system to trigger pruning based on certain conditions, such as when the blockchain reaches a certain size.

Here is an example of how the `ManualPruningTrigger` class could be used:

```csharp
// Create an instance of the ManualPruningTrigger class
var pruningTrigger = new ManualPruningTrigger();

// Subscribe to the Prune event to be notified when pruning is triggered
pruningTrigger.Prune += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Pruning triggered with status: {args.Status}");
};

// Trigger pruning
var status = pruningTrigger.Trigger();

// Check the status of the pruning operation
if (status == PruningStatus.Success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Pruning completed successfully");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Pruning failed with status: {status}");
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `ManualPruningTrigger` class and subscribe to the `Prune` event to be notified when pruning is triggered. We then call the `Trigger()` method to manually trigger pruning and check the status of the pruning operation. Depending on the status, we output a message to the console to indicate whether pruning was successful or not.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IPruningTrigger` interface that `ManualPruningTrigger` implements?
- The `IPruningTrigger` interface likely defines a set of methods or events related to triggering pruning in the blockchain, and `ManualPruningTrigger` provides an implementation for this interface.

2. What is the `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class used for?
- The `PruningTriggerEventArgs` class likely contains information or data related to the event of triggering pruning, and is used to pass this information to event subscribers.

3. What is the significance of the `Prune` event in the `ManualPruningTrigger` class?
- The `Prune` event is likely triggered when pruning is manually triggered using the `Trigger()` method, and allows subscribers to perform actions or receive information related to the pruning process.
