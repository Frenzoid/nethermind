The `PruningTriggerPersistenceStrategy` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to persist state trie to the database after the next block of full pruning trigger. This class is used when both memory pruning and full pruning are enabled. The purpose of this class is to store the state trie to the database to be able to copy this trie into a new database in full pruning.

The class implements the `IPersistenceStrategy` interface and the `IDisposable` interface. It has three private fields: `_fullPruningDb`, `_blockTree`, and `_logger`. The `_fullPruningDb` field is of type `IFullPruningDb` and is used to access the full pruning database. The `_blockTree` field is of type `IBlockTree` and is used to access the block tree. The `_logger` field is of type `ILogger` and is used to log messages.

The class has two event handlers: `OnPruningStarted` and `OnPruningFinished`. The `OnPruningStarted` event handler is called when full pruning is started. It sets the `_inPruning` field to 1 and sets the `_minPersistedBlock` field to null. If the logger is in debug mode, it logs a message. The `OnPruningFinished` event handler is called when full pruning is finished. If the logger is in debug mode, it logs a message. It sets the `_inPruning` field to 0 and sets the `_minPersistedBlock` field to null.

The class has a `ShouldPersist` method that takes a `long` block number as a parameter and returns a `bool`. The method checks if `_inPruning` is not equal to 0. If it is, it sets the `_minPersistedBlock` field to the block number. If the block number is greater than `_minPersistedBlock` plus `Reorganization.MaxDepth`, it sets the `BestPersistedState` property of the `_blockTree` field to `blockNumber - Reorganization.MaxDepth`. If the logger is in info mode, it logs a message. The method returns `inPruning`.

The class is used to persist state trie to the database after the next block of full pruning trigger. It is used when both memory pruning and full pruning are enabled. The class stores the state trie to the database to be able to copy this trie into a new database in full pruning. The class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to manage the full pruning process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `PruningTriggerPersistenceStrategy` that implements the `IPersistenceStrategy` interface and is used to persist state trie to DB after the next block of full pruning trigger.

2. What other classes or interfaces does this code depend on?
    
    This code depends on several other classes and interfaces including `IFullPruningDb`, `IBlockTree`, `ILogManager`, `IPruningTrigger`, and `Reorganization`.

3. What is the significance of the `PruningStarted` and `PruningFinished` events?
    
    The `PruningStarted` and `PruningFinished` events are used to set and reset the `_inPruning` flag respectively, which is used to determine whether state changes should be persisted. When pruning is started, all state changes are persisted until pruning is finished.
