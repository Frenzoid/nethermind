The `ManualBlockFinalizationManager` class and `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface are part of the Nethermind blockchain project and are used for managing the finalization of blocks. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to manually finalize blocks in the blockchain. When a block is finalized, it means that it has been verified and added to the blockchain permanently. The `ManualBlockFinalizationManager` class implements the `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface, which defines the methods and properties required for block finalization.

The `ManualBlockFinalizationManager` class has two properties: `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` and `LastFinalizedHash`. These properties keep track of the last block that was finalized and its hash value. The `MarkFinalized` method is used to mark a block as finalized. It takes two `BlockHeader` objects as parameters: `finalizingBlock` and `finalizedBlock`. The `finalizedBlock` parameter is the block that is being finalized, and the `finalizingBlock` parameter is the block that is being used to finalize the `finalizedBlock`. When a block is finalized, the `BlocksFinalized` event is raised, which can be used to notify other parts of the system that a block has been finalized.

The `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface extends the `IBlockFinalizationManager` interface and adds the `LastFinalizedHash` property and the `MarkFinalized` method. The `LastFinalizedHash` property returns the hash value of the last block that was finalized.

This code can be used in the larger Nethermind project to manage the finalization of blocks in the blockchain. Other parts of the system can use the `BlocksFinalized` event to perform additional processing when a block is finalized. For example, the event could be used to update the state of the blockchain or to notify users that a new block has been added to the chain.

Example usage:

```
// Create a new instance of the ManualBlockFinalizationManager class
var blockFinalizationManager = new ManualBlockFinalizationManager();

// Mark a block as finalized
var finalizingBlock = new BlockHeader();
var finalizedBlock = new BlockHeader();
blockFinalizationManager.MarkFinalized(finalizingBlock, finalizedBlock);

// Get the hash value of the last finalized block
var lastFinalizedHash = blockFinalizationManager.LastFinalizedHash;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ManualBlockFinalizationManager` class?
    
    The `ManualBlockFinalizationManager` class is an implementation of the `IManualBlockFinalizationManager` interface and is used for marking finalized blocks and keeping track of the last finalized block level and hash.

2. Why are the `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` and `LastFinalizedHash` properties not saved in a database?
    
    The comments in the code suggest that saving the `LastFinalizedBlockLevel` and `LastFinalizedHash` properties in a database is not necessary at the moment.

3. What is the `BlocksFinalized` event used for?
    
    The `BlocksFinalized` event is raised when blocks are finalized and can be subscribed to by other parts of the code to perform additional actions when blocks are finalized.
