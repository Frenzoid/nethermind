The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to retrieve transaction receipts from the blockchain. It implements the `IReceiptFinder` interface and provides methods to retrieve receipts for a given block or transaction hash.

The class takes three dependencies in its constructor: `IReceiptStorage`, `IReceiptsRecovery`, and `IBlockFinder`. These dependencies are used to retrieve and recover receipts from the blockchain.

The `FindBlockHash` method takes a transaction hash as input and returns the block hash for the block that contains the transaction. This method is used to find the block hash for a given transaction hash.

The `Get` method is overloaded and takes either a `Block` or a `Keccak` block hash as input. It retrieves the receipts for the given block and attempts to recover any missing receipts using the `IReceiptsRecovery` dependency. If any receipts are missing, the method attempts to recover them by calling the `TryRecover` method of the `IReceiptsRecovery` dependency. If recovery is successful, the recovered receipts are inserted into the `IReceiptStorage` dependency using the `Insert` method. The method then returns the receipts for the given block.

The `CanGetReceiptsByHash` method takes a block number as input and returns a boolean indicating whether receipts can be retrieved for the given block number. This method is used to check if receipts can be retrieved for a given block number.

The `TryGetReceiptsIterator` method takes a block number and block hash as input and returns a boolean indicating whether a `ReceiptsIterator` can be retrieved for the given block number and block hash. This method is used to retrieve a `ReceiptsIterator` for a given block number and block hash.

Overall, the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class is an important part of the Nethermind project as it provides a way to retrieve transaction receipts from the blockchain. It uses several dependencies to retrieve and recover receipts and provides methods to check if receipts can be retrieved for a given block number and to retrieve a `ReceiptsIterator` for a given block number and block hash.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class is an implementation of the `IReceiptFinder` interface and provides methods for retrieving transaction receipts from a blockchain.

2. What are the dependencies of the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class has three dependencies: an `IReceiptStorage` instance, an `IReceiptsRecovery` instance, and an `IBlockFinder` instance.

3. What is the purpose of the `Get` method in the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class?
- The `Get` method in the `FullInfoReceiptFinder` class retrieves transaction receipts for a given block. If the receipts need to be recovered, it attempts to recover them and reinsert them into the storage.
