The `GenesisLoader` class is responsible for loading the genesis block of a blockchain. The genesis block is the first block of a blockchain and is usually hardcoded into the client software. It contains the initial state of the blockchain, including the initial distribution of funds and the code for any smart contracts that are deployed at genesis.

The `GenesisLoader` class takes in several dependencies, including a `ChainSpec` object, which contains the configuration for the blockchain, a `SpecProvider` object, which provides access to the Ethereum specification, a `StateProvider` object, which provides access to the state trie, a `StorageProvider` object, which provides access to the storage trie, and a `TransactionProcessor` object, which is responsible for executing transactions.

The `Load` method is the main entry point for the `GenesisLoader` class. It loads the genesis block from the `ChainSpec` object and preallocates the initial state of the blockchain. The `Preallocate` method is responsible for creating accounts, updating code, setting storage values, and executing any constructor functions for smart contracts that are deployed at genesis.

Once the initial state has been preallocated, the `GenesisLoader` class commits the state and storage tries to disk and sets the state root and block hash of the genesis block. The genesis block is then returned to the caller.

The `GenesisLoader` class is used by the `Blockchain` class to initialize the blockchain. The `Blockchain` class is responsible for managing the state of the blockchain, including adding new blocks and processing transactions. The `GenesisLoader` class is only used once, when the blockchain is first initialized.

Example usage:

```csharp
var chainSpec = new ChainSpec();
var specProvider = new SpecProvider();
var stateProvider = new StateProvider();
var storageProvider = new StorageProvider();
var transactionProcessor = new TransactionProcessor();

var genesisLoader = new GenesisLoader(chainSpec, specProvider, stateProvider, storageProvider, transactionProcessor);
var genesisBlock = genesisLoader.Load();

var blockchain = new Blockchain(genesisBlock, specProvider, stateProvider, storageProvider, transactionProcessor);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GenesisLoader` class?
- The `GenesisLoader` class is responsible for loading the genesis block of a blockchain and preallocating accounts, code, storage, and constructors specified in the `ChainSpec`.

2. What are the dependencies of the `GenesisLoader` class?
- The `GenesisLoader` class depends on a `ChainSpec`, `ISpecProvider`, `IStateProvider`, `IStorageProvider`, and `ITransactionProcessor`.

3. What does the `Load` method do?
- The `Load` method loads the genesis block specified in the `ChainSpec`, preallocates accounts, code, storage, and constructors, commits the state and storage to the database, and returns the genesis block.
