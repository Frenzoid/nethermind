The `ReceiptMigration` class is a database migration step that is responsible for migrating receipts from the old database to the new one. It implements the `IDatabaseMigration` and `IReceiptsMigration` interfaces. The class is part of the Nethermind project and is located in the `Nethermind.Init.Steps.Migrations` namespace.

The purpose of this class is to migrate receipts from the old database to the new one. The receipts are stored in the `IReceiptStorage` interface, which is injected into the class constructor. The migration is triggered by calling the `Run` method, which takes a block number as a parameter. The method cancels the current migration task, if any, and starts a new one. The `DisposeAsync` method cancels the current migration task and disposes of any resources used by the class.

The `RunMigration` method is responsible for migrating the receipts. It retrieves the block bodies for migration and iterates over them. For each block, it retrieves the receipts from the `IReceiptStorage` interface and inserts them into the new database. It also deletes the receipts from the old database. If any receipts are missing, it logs a warning message. The method also updates the `MigratedBlockNumber` property of the `IReceiptStorage` interface.

The `CanMigrate` method checks if the migration can be performed in the current sync mode. If not, it registers an event handler for the `Changed` event of the `ISyncModeSelector` interface and logs an info message.

The `OnSyncModeChanged` method is called when the sync mode changes. If the migration can be performed in the new sync mode, it calls the `RunMigration` method and unregisters the event handler.

The `GetMissingBlock` method creates an empty block with the specified number and hash. It is used when a block is missing from the block tree.

The `GetLogMessage` method creates a log message with the specified status and suffix. It includes information about the progress of the migration.

Overall, the `ReceiptMigration` class is an important part of the Nethermind project, as it ensures that receipts are migrated from the old database to the new one. It provides a way to migrate receipts in a controlled and efficient manner.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a database migration step for migrating receipts to a new database. It is responsible for migrating receipts from the old database to the new one, and deleting the migrated receipts from the old database.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code has dependencies on several interfaces and classes, including `IApiWithNetwork`, `IReceiptStorage`, `IDbProvider`, `DisposableStack`, `IBlockTree`, `ISyncModeSelector`, `IChainLevelInfoRepository`, and `IReceiptConfig`.

3. What is the main functionality of the `RunMigration` method?
   
   The `RunMigration` method is responsible for migrating receipts from the old database to the new one. It does this by iterating over blocks in reverse order, getting the receipts for each block from the old database, inserting them into the new database, and then deleting them from the old database. It also logs progress and handles cancellation.
