The `FilterBootnodes` class is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project. It is responsible for filtering out bootnodes that have the same public key as the current node. Bootnodes are a set of nodes that are used to bootstrap the network discovery process. 

The class implements the `IStep` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Execute` method. The method takes a `CancellationToken` parameter, which is not used in this implementation. The method first checks if the `ChainSpec` property of the `_api` field is null. If it is null, the method returns a completed task. If it is not null, the method checks if the `NodeKey` property of the `_api` field is null. If it is null, the method returns a completed task. 

If both properties are not null, the method filters the `Bootnodes` property of the `ChainSpec` object. The `Bootnodes` property is an array of `NetworkNode` objects, which represent the bootnodes of the network. The `Where` LINQ method is used to filter the array based on a condition. The condition checks if the `NodeId` property of each `NetworkNode` object is not equal to the public key of the current node. If the condition is true, the `NetworkNode` object is included in the filtered array. If the condition is false, the `NetworkNode` object is excluded from the filtered array. 

The filtered array is then assigned back to the `Bootnodes` property of the `ChainSpec` object. If the `Bootnodes` property was null, an empty array is assigned instead. The method then returns a completed task. 

This class is used in the initialization process of the Nethermind project to ensure that bootnodes with the same public key as the current node are not used for network discovery. This helps to prevent network partitioning and ensures that the network is healthy. An example usage of this class is shown below:

```
INethermindApi api = new NethermindApi();
FilterBootnodes filterBootnodes = new FilterBootnodes(api);
await filterBootnodes.Execute(CancellationToken.None);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind node software, and it filters out bootnodes that have the same public key as the node itself.

2. What is the significance of the `[RunnerStepDependencies(typeof(SetupKeyStore))]` attribute?
   - This attribute indicates that this step depends on the `SetupKeyStore` step being executed first, and ensures that the initialization process is executed in the correct order.

3. What is the difference between `_api.ChainSpec.Bootnodes?.Where(...)` and `_api.ChainSpec.Bootnodes.Where(...)`?
   - The `?.` operator is used to perform a null-conditional check on `_api.ChainSpec.Bootnodes`, and if it is null, the expression returns null instead of throwing a null reference exception.
