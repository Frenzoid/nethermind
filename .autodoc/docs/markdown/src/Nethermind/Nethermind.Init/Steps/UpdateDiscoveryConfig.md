The `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class is a step in the initialization process of the Nethermind project. It updates the discovery configuration of the node based on the chain specification and bootnodes. 

The class implements the `IStep` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Execute` method. The `Execute` method takes a `CancellationToken` parameter and returns a `Task`. The method calls the `Update` method and returns a completed task.

The `Update` method first checks if the `ChainSpec` property of the `INethermindApi` instance is not null. If it is null, the method returns without making any changes. Otherwise, it retrieves the `IDiscoveryConfig` instance from the `INethermindApi` instance and checks if the `Bootnodes` property is not empty. If it is not empty, the method appends the chain specification bootnodes to the existing bootnodes. If the `Bootnodes` property is empty, the method sets it to the chain specification bootnodes.

The `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` class is decorated with the `[RunnerStepDependencies(typeof(FilterBootnodes))]` attribute, which specifies that this step depends on the `FilterBootnodes` step. This means that the `FilterBootnodes` step must be executed before the `UpdateDiscoveryConfig` step.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to ensure that the node's discovery configuration is up-to-date with the chain specification and bootnodes. This is important for the node to be able to discover and connect to other nodes on the network. 

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the initialization process of the Nethermind project:

```
INethermindApi api = new NethermindApi();
UpdateDiscoveryConfig updateDiscoveryConfig = new UpdateDiscoveryConfig(api);
await updateDiscoveryConfig.Execute(CancellationToken.None);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is updating the discovery configuration for the Nethermind network by adding bootnodes specified in the chain spec.

2. What is the significance of the `[RunnerStepDependencies]` attribute?
   - The `[RunnerStepDependencies]` attribute specifies the dependencies of this step in the initialization process of the Nethermind node.

3. What is the role of the `IDiscoveryConfig` interface?
   - The `IDiscoveryConfig` interface provides access to the discovery configuration settings for the Nethermind network. This code is using it to update the bootnodes setting.
