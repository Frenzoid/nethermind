[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/Nethermind.Init/Cpu/ProcCpuInfoKeyNames.cs)

This code defines a static class called `ProcCpuInfoKeyNames` that contains several constant strings representing key names for various CPU information. These key names are used to extract specific CPU information from a system's `/proc/cpuinfo` file. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of key names for CPU information that can be used throughout the larger project. By defining these key names as constants in a single location, it ensures that the same key names are used consistently across the project, reducing the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies.

For example, if another part of the project needs to extract the number of CPU cores, it can simply reference `ProcCpuInfoKeyNames.CpuCores` instead of hardcoding the string "cpu cores". This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger Nethermind project, helping to ensure consistency and maintainability throughout the codebase.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a static class `ProcCpuInfoKeyNames` with constant string values representing various CPU information key names.

2. What is the significance of the `internal` access modifier used in this code?
- The `internal` access modifier restricts access to the class and its members to within the same assembly (i.e. project), meaning that they cannot be accessed from outside the `Nethermind.Init.Cpu` namespace.

3. What is the origin of the code that this file is derived from?
- This code file is derived from the `BenchmarkDotNet` project on GitHub, which is licensed under the MIT License.
