The `ProcCpuInfoParser` class is responsible for parsing the output of the `proc/cpuinfo` command on Linux systems to extract information about the CPU(s) installed on the system. This information is then used to create a `CpuInfo` object that contains details about the CPU(s) such as the number of logical cores, physical cores, clock speeds, and model names.

The `ParseOutput` method is the main entry point for this class and takes a string containing the output of the `proc/cpuinfo` command as input. It first calls the `ParseSections` method from the `SectionsHelper` class to split the input string into sections based on the `:` character. Each section represents a logical core on the CPU(s) and contains key-value pairs that describe various properties of that core.

The method then iterates over each logical core section and extracts the relevant information. It uses a `Dictionary` to keep track of the number of physical cores associated with each CPU and a `HashSet` to keep track of the different model names of the CPUs. It also extracts the nominal, minimum, and maximum clock speeds from the `ModelName`, `MinFrequency`, and `MaxFrequency` properties respectively.

Finally, the method creates a new `CpuInfo` object using the extracted information and returns it. The `ParseFrequencyFromBrandString` method is a helper method that extracts the clock speed from the `ModelName` property using a regular expression and returns it as a `Frequency` object.

This class is likely used in the larger project to gather information about the CPU(s) running the Nethermind node software. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the software by taking advantage of the specific features of the CPU(s) installed on the system. For example, if the system has multiple physical cores, the software can be configured to take advantage of parallel processing to improve performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a static class `ProcCpuInfoParser` with two methods: `ParseOutput` and `ParseFrequencyFromBrandString`. `ParseOutput` takes in a string and returns an instance of `CpuInfo`, while `ParseFrequencyFromBrandString` takes in a string and returns a `Frequency` object.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the `System.Collections.Generic`, `System.Linq`, and `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespaces.

3. What is the license for this code?
- This code is licensed under the LGPL-3.0-only and MIT licenses, as indicated by the SPDX-License-Identifier comments at the beginning of the file.
