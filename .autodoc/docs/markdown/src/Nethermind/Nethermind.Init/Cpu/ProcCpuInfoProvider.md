The `ProcCpuInfoProvider` class is responsible for providing information about the CPU of the machine running the Nethermind application. This information is obtained by parsing the output of the `cat /proc/cpuinfo` command, which is a Linux-specific command that provides detailed information about the CPU of the system. 

The `ProcCpuInfoProvider` class is an internal static class, which means that it is not accessible from outside the `Nethermind.Init.Cpu` namespace. It contains a single static field called `ProcCpuInfo`, which is a `Lazy` object that is initialized with the `Load` method. The `Load` method checks if the current runtime is Linux and, if so, reads the output of the `cat /proc/cpuinfo` command and passes it to the `ProcCpuInfoParser.ParseOutput` method, which parses the output and returns a `CpuInfo` object. If the runtime is not Linux, the `Load` method returns `null`.

The `ProcCpuInfoProvider` class also contains two private static methods: `GetCpuSpeed` and `ParseCpuFrequencies`. The `GetCpuSpeed` method runs the `lscpu | grep MHz` command and parses the output to obtain the minimum and maximum CPU frequencies. The `ParseCpuFrequencies` method takes an array of strings as input, which contains the output of the `lscpu | grep MHz` command, and extracts the minimum and maximum CPU frequencies from it.

The `ProcCpuInfoProvider` class is used in the larger Nethermind project to provide information about the CPU of the system running the application. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the application by taking advantage of the specific features of the CPU. For example, if the CPU supports AVX2 instructions, the application can use these instructions to perform certain operations faster than if it used standard instructions. 

Here is an example of how the `ProcCpuInfoProvider` class can be used in the Nethermind project:

```csharp
var cpuInfo = ProcCpuInfoProvider.ProcCpuInfo.Value;
if (cpuInfo != null)
{
    if (cpuInfo.AVX2)
    {
        // Use AVX2 instructions to perform certain operations
    }
    else
    {
        // Use standard instructions to perform certain operations
    }
}
else
{
    // CPU information is not available
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides CPU information from the output of the `cat /proc/info` command on Linux systems.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code depends on the `ProcessHelper` class and the `Frequency` and `ProcCpuInfoParser` classes from other parts of the `nethermind` project.

3. What is the format of the CPU information returned by this code?
    
    The CPU information returned by this code includes the minimum and maximum CPU frequencies in MHz, and is formatted as a string with key-value pairs separated by tabs.
