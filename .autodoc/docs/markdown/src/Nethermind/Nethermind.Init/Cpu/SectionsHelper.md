The code in this file provides helper methods for parsing sections of text. Specifically, it defines a static class called `SectionsHelper` with two methods: `ParseSection` and `ParseSections`. These methods take in a string of text and a separator character, and return a dictionary or list of dictionaries, respectively, containing key-value pairs parsed from the input text.

The `ParseSection` method takes in a single section of text (i.e. a string containing one or more lines of text separated by a newline character) and a separator character. It splits the section into individual lines, and for each line that contains the separator character, it splits the line into two parts (before and after the separator) and adds a key-value pair to a dictionary. The resulting dictionary contains all the key-value pairs parsed from the input section.

The `ParseSections` method takes in a string of text containing multiple sections (i.e. one or more sections separated by two or more newline characters) and a separator character. It splits the input text into individual sections using a regular expression, and for each section, it calls the `ParseSection` method to parse the key-value pairs. The resulting list contains one dictionary for each section parsed from the input text.

These methods are used in the larger project to parse configuration files and other text-based data formats. For example, the `ParseSection` method could be used to parse a single section of an INI file, while the `ParseSections` method could be used to parse multiple sections of an output file from a command-line tool. By providing a simple and reusable way to parse text data, this code helps to reduce duplication and improve maintainability across the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    - This code defines a static helper class called `SectionsHelper` that contains two methods for parsing sections of text into dictionaries.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    - This code uses the `System` and `System.Collections.Generic` namespaces from the .NET framework, as well as the `System.Linq` and `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespaces.

3. What is the expected input format for the `ParseSections` method?
    - The `ParseSections` method expects a string containing one or more sections of text separated by two or more newline characters. Each section should contain key-value pairs separated by a single character specified by the `separator` parameter.
