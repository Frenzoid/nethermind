The `FrequencyUnit` class is a utility class that defines different frequency units and their corresponding values in Hertz. It is used to convert between different frequency units and to represent frequency values in a consistent manner throughout the project.

The class defines four static instances of `FrequencyUnit` representing the most common frequency units: Hz, KHz, MHz, and GHz. Each instance has a name, a description, and a Hertz amount. The `All` field is an array containing all the instances of `FrequencyUnit`.

The `ToFrequency` method is used to create a new `Frequency` object from a given value and the current `FrequencyUnit`. The `Frequency` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely used to represent frequency values in other parts of the project.

This class is likely used in other parts of the project where frequency values need to be represented or converted between different units. For example, it could be used in a performance monitoring module to report the frequency of the CPU or other hardware components. It could also be used in a benchmarking module to compare the performance of different algorithms or implementations on different hardware configurations. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new FrequencyUnit instance representing 2 GHz
FrequencyUnit frequencyUnit = new FrequencyUnit("GHz", "Gigahertz", 2000000000L);

// create a new Frequency instance representing 1 GHz
Frequency frequency = frequencyUnit.ToFrequency();

// output the frequency value in MHz
Console.WriteLine(frequency.ToUnit(FrequencyUnit.MHz)); // output: 2000
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `FrequencyUnit` that represents different units of frequency and provides a method to convert a value to a `Frequency` object.

2. What external libraries or resources does this code use?
- This code uses a library called `perfolizer` from the GitHub repository `AndreyAkinshin/perfolizer`, which is licensed under the MIT License.

3. What are the available units of frequency and their corresponding values?
- The available units of frequency are `Hz` (1L), `KHz` (1000L), `MHz` (1000000L), and `GHz` (1000000000L). These values represent the number of hertz in each unit.
