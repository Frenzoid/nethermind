The `LimboLogs` class is a logging utility that redirects logs to nowhere, or "limbo". It is intended to be used in tests to ensure that any potential issues with log message construction are caught. 

When constructing log messages, it is common to use conditional statements to check if a certain log level is enabled before actually constructing the message. For example, `if(_logger.IsTrace) _logger.Trace("somethingThatIsNull.ToString()")`. However, this can lead to issues where errors in the message construction are not caught until the log level is actually enabled. This can slow down tests and increase memory usage due to log file generation. 

To avoid this issue, `LimboLogs` returns a logger that always causes the log message to be created, regardless of the log level. This ensures that any errors in message construction are caught during testing. 

The `LimboLogs` class implements the `ILogManager` interface, which defines methods for getting loggers for different contexts. However, all of the methods in `LimboLogs` simply return the same instance of the `LimboTraceLogger` class, which is a logger that logs to nowhere. 

Overall, `LimboLogs` is a useful utility for testing log message construction and ensuring that errors are caught early. It can be used in conjunction with other logging utilities in the `Nethermind` project to provide comprehensive logging functionality. 

Example usage:

```
// Get a logger for a specific class
ILogger logger = LimboLogs.Instance.GetClassLogger(typeof(MyClass));

// Log a message
logger.Info("This message will be logged to nowhere");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LimboLogs` class and when should it be used?
   
   The `LimboLogs` class is used to redirect logs to nowhere and should be used in tests to ensure that any potential issues with log message construction are tested.

2. How does using `LimboLogs` help with testing log message construction?
   
   Using `LimboLogs` ensures that log messages are always created, allowing for the detection of errors such as `somethingThatIsNull.ToString()` throwing an error.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetClassLogger` and `GetLogger` methods in the `LimboLogs` class?
   
   The `GetClassLogger` and `GetLogger` methods return an instance of the `LimboTraceLogger` class, which is used to log messages to nowhere.
