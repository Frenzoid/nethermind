The `SimpleConsoleLogger` class is a basic implementation of the `ILogger` interface in the Nethermind project. It is intended to be used as a temporary logger before the actual logger is configured. This class provides a simple way to log messages to the console, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

The `SimpleConsoleLogger` class has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. Instead, it provides a public static property called `Instance`, which returns a single instance of the `SimpleConsoleLogger` class. This is implemented as a singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the lifetime of the application.

The `SimpleConsoleLogger` class implements the `ILogger` interface, which defines a set of methods for logging messages at different levels of severity. The `Info`, `Warn`, `Debug`, `Trace`, and `Error` methods all write the specified message to the console, along with a timestamp. The `Error` method also takes an optional `Exception` parameter, which can be used to log additional information about the error.

The `SimpleConsoleLogger` class also provides a set of boolean properties (`IsInfo`, `IsWarn`, `IsDebug`, `IsTrace`, and `IsError`) that indicate whether messages at each level of severity should be logged. In this implementation, all of these properties are set to `true`, which means that all messages will be logged.

Overall, the `SimpleConsoleLogger` class provides a simple way to log messages to the console, which can be useful for debugging purposes. It is intended to be used as a temporary logger before the actual logger is configured, and provides a basic implementation of the `ILogger` interface. Here is an example of how to use the `SimpleConsoleLogger` class:

```
ILogger logger = SimpleConsoleLogger.Instance;
logger.Info("This is an info message");
logger.Warn("This is a warning message");
logger.Debug("This is a debug message");
logger.Trace("This is a trace message");
logger.Error("This is an error message", new Exception("Something went wrong"));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a simple console logger class that can be used before a logger is configured.

2. How does this logger handle errors?
   - The `Error` method takes in an optional `Exception` parameter and writes the error message along with the exception to the console.

3. Can the logging levels be customized?
   - No, the logging levels (`IsInfo`, `IsWarn`, `IsDebug`, `IsTrace`, `IsError`) are hardcoded to always return `true`.
