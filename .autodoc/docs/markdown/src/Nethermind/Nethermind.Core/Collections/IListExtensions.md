The `ListExtensions` class provides a set of extension methods for the `IList` and `IReadOnlyList` interfaces. These methods are designed to simplify common operations on lists and improve code readability.

The `ForEach` method is an extension method for `IReadOnlyList` that allows you to perform an action on each element of the list. It takes an `Action<T>` delegate as a parameter, which is called for each element in the list.

The `GetItemRoundRobin` method is an extension method for `IList` that returns an item from the list based on a given index. If the index is greater than the number of items in the list, it wraps around to the beginning of the list. This method is useful for implementing round-robin load balancing algorithms.

The `BinarySearch` method is an extension method for `IList` that performs a binary search on the list. It takes a `Func<TSearch, TItem, int>` delegate as a parameter, which is used to compare the search value with the items in the list. The method returns the index of the search value if it is found, or the bitwise complement of the index of the next largest item if it is not found.

The `TryGetSearchedItem` method is an extension method for `IList` that attempts to retrieve an item from the list based on a search value. It takes a `Func<TComparable, T, int>` delegate as a parameter, which is used to compare the search value with the items in the list. If the item is found, it is returned as an `out` parameter and the method returns `true`. If the item is not found, the method returns `false` and the `out` parameter is set to `default`.

The `TryGetForBlock` method is an extension method for `IList<long>` that attempts to retrieve a block number from the list. It is a specialized version of `TryGetSearchedItem` that uses `long` as the search value and comparison function.

Overall, these extension methods provide a convenient way to work with lists in the Nethermind project. They can be used to simplify common operations and improve code readability. For example, the `ForEach` method can be used to iterate over a list and perform an action on each element, while the `BinarySearch` method can be used to efficiently search for an item in a sorted list.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ListExtensions` class?
- The `ListExtensions` class provides extension methods for `IList` and `IReadOnlyList` interfaces.

2. What is the purpose of the `BinarySearch` method?
- The `BinarySearch` method performs a binary search on a specified collection and returns the index of the searched item.

3. What is the purpose of the `TryGetSearchedItem` method?
- The `TryGetSearchedItem` method attempts to retrieve the searched item from a specified list using a binary search and returns a boolean indicating whether the item was found or not.
