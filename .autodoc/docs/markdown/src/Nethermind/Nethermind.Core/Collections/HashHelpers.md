The `HashHelpers` class provides a set of helper methods and constants for working with hash tables. The class is adapted from the .NET source code and is used to provide a set of common hash table operations that can be used across the Nethermind project.

The class provides a set of constants that define the maximum prime array length, the hash collision threshold, and the hash prime. It also provides an array of prime numbers that can be used as hash table sizes. These prime numbers are used to determine the size of the hash table when it needs to be resized. The class provides a `GetPrime` method that returns the smallest prime number in the array that is larger than twice the previous capacity. The `ExpandPrime` method uses this method to determine the size of the hash table to grow to.

The class also provides a set of helper methods for working with primes. The `IsPrime` method determines whether a given number is prime. The `GetFastModMultiplier` method returns an approximate reciprocal of the divisor, which is used to perform a mod operation. The `FastMod` method performs a mod operation using the multiplier pre-computed with `GetFastModMultiplier`.

Finally, the class provides a `SerializationInfoTable` property that returns a `ConditionalWeakTable` object that can be used to store serialization information for objects. This property is lazily initialized using the `Interlocked.CompareExchange` method to ensure that it is only created once.

Overall, the `HashHelpers` class provides a set of common hash table operations that can be used across the Nethermind project. It provides a set of constants and helper methods for working with primes, as well as a `SerializationInfoTable` property for storing serialization information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
    
    This code file contains a static class `HashHelpers` that provides helper methods and constants for hash table operations.

2. What is the significance of the `s_primes` array?
    
    The `s_primes` array contains a list of prime numbers that are used as hash table sizes. When a hash table needs to be resized, the smallest prime number in this array that is larger than twice the previous capacity is chosen.

3. What is the purpose of the `SerializationInfoTable` property?
    
    The `SerializationInfoTable` property returns a `ConditionalWeakTable` that can be used to associate serialization information with an object. This is useful for serialization and deserialization operations.
