The `LinkedHashSet` class is a custom implementation of a set data structure that maintains the order of elements as they are added. It is a generic class that can be used with any type that is not null. The class implements the `ISet<T>` and `IReadOnlySet<T>` interfaces, which provide a set of methods for working with sets.

The `LinkedHashSet` class uses a combination of a dictionary and a linked list to maintain the set. The dictionary is used to store the elements of the set as keys, and the corresponding values are the nodes of the linked list. The linked list is used to maintain the order of the elements as they are added or removed from the set.

The class provides several constructors that allow the user to create a new set with an initial capacity, an optional equality comparer, or to initialize the set with an existing collection of elements.

The `LinkedHashSet` class provides implementations for all the methods defined in the `ISet<T>` interface. These methods include `Add`, `Remove`, `Clear`, `Contains`, `UnionWith`, `IntersectWith`, `ExceptWith`, `SymmetricExceptWith`, `IsSubsetOf`, `IsSupersetOf`, `IsProperSubsetOf`, `IsProperSupersetOf`, `Overlaps`, and `SetEquals`. These methods allow the user to perform set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

The `LinkedHashSet` class also provides implementations for the `ICollection<T>` interface, which includes methods such as `CopyTo` and `Count`. The class also provides implementations for the `IEnumerable<T>` and `IEnumerable` interfaces, which allow the user to iterate over the elements of the set.

Overall, the `LinkedHashSet` class provides a custom implementation of a set data structure that maintains the order of elements as they are added. It can be used in any scenario where a set is required, and the order of elements is important.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom implementation of a linked hash set data structure in C#.

2. What is the benefit of using a linked hash set over a regular hash set?
- A linked hash set maintains the order of elements as they are added, in addition to providing constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

3. What is the significance of the `notnull` constraint on the generic type parameter `T`?
- This constraint ensures that the type `T` cannot be assigned a null value, which is useful for avoiding null reference exceptions in the implementation of the data structure.
