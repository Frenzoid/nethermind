The `TypeDiscovery` class is responsible for discovering all types in the Nethermind project that inherit from a given base type or have a specific name. It does this by loading all assemblies in the current `AssemblyLoadContext` and filtering out any that are not part of the Nethermind project. 

The `LoadAll` method is called to load all assemblies and their dependencies. It first checks if the assemblies have already been loaded by checking the `_allLoaded` flag. If not, it calls the `LoadAllImpl` method to load all assemblies. The `LoadAllImpl` method first locks the `_lock` object to ensure thread safety. It then iterates through all assemblies in the `AssemblyLoadContext`, skipping any that are not part of the Nethermind project. It adds each assembly to a `considered` dictionary, which is used to keep track of all assemblies that have been considered. It also adds each assembly to a `loadedAssemblies` list. 

The `LoadOnce` method is then called to load any missing dependencies. It first filters out any assemblies that have already been considered or have a null name. It then iterates through all missing references and loads them using `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyName`. It adds each loaded assembly to the `considered` dictionary and adds any new references to the end of the `missingRefs` list. This process continues until all dependencies have been loaded.

The `FindNethermindTypes` methods are then called to find all types that inherit from a given base type or have a specific name. They first call the `LoadAll` method to ensure that all assemblies have been loaded. They then iterate through all assemblies in the `_nethermindAssemblies` set, which contains all assemblies that are part of the Nethermind project. They use `GetExportedTypes` to get all types in each assembly and filter out any that do not inherit from the given base type or have a different name than the specified name. The resulting types are returned as an `IEnumerable<Type>`.

This class is used in the larger Nethermind project to dynamically discover all types that are part of the project. This is useful for plugins or other extensions that need to interact with types in the Nethermind project without having to reference them directly. For example, a plugin that needs to interact with the `Block` class can use `TypeDiscovery.FindNethermindTypes(typeof(Block))` to get all types that inherit from `Block`. This allows the plugin to work with any custom implementations of `Block` that may be added to the project in the future.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadAll` method and how is it used?
    
    The `LoadAll` method is used to load all the assemblies that are not already loaded and add them to a list of considered assemblies. It is called by the `FindNethermindTypes` methods to ensure that all relevant assemblies are loaded before searching for types.

2. What is the significance of the `_nethermindAssemblies` field and how is it populated?
    
    The `_nethermindAssemblies` field is a HashSet that stores all the assemblies that contain types that are relevant to the Nethermind project. It is populated by iterating through the `considered` dictionary and adding any assemblies that have a name that starts with "Nethermind".

3. What is the purpose of the `LoadOnce` method and how is it used?
    
    The `LoadOnce` method is used to load all the assemblies that are referenced by the assemblies in the `loadedAssemblies` list and add them to the `considered` dictionary. It is called by the `LoadAllImpl` method to ensure that all relevant assemblies are loaded before searching for types.
