The `StorageCell` struct is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to represent a storage cell in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is a virtual machine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. 

The `StorageCell` struct has two properties: `Address` and `Index`. The `Address` property is of type `Address` and represents the address of the contract that the storage cell belongs to. The `Index` property is of type `UInt256` and represents the index of the storage cell within the contract's storage. 

The `StorageCell` struct implements the `IEquatable` interface, which allows for comparison of two `StorageCell` instances for equality. The `Equals` method is overridden to compare the `Index` and `Address` properties of two `StorageCell` instances. The `GetHashCode` method is also overridden to generate a hash code based on the `Address` and `Index` properties. 

The `ToString` method is overridden to return a string representation of the `StorageCell` instance in the format of `{Address}.{Index}`. 

This struct is used throughout the Nethermind project to represent storage cells in the EVM. For example, it may be used in the implementation of the `State` class, which represents the state of the EVM at a particular point in time. The `State` class may use `StorageCell` instances to access and modify the storage of a contract. 

Example usage:

```
Address contractAddress = new Address("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");
UInt256 storageIndex = UInt256.FromBytes(new byte[] { 0x01 });
StorageCell storageCell = new StorageCell(contractAddress, storageIndex);

Console.WriteLine(storageCell.ToString()); // Output: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890.1
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StorageCell` struct?
    
    The `StorageCell` struct represents a storage cell in Ethereum's state trie, identified by an address and an index.

2. What is the significance of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute on the `StorageCell` struct?
    
    The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute specifies how the `StorageCell` struct should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it will display the address and index of the storage cell.

3. What is the `UInt256` type used for in this code?
    
    The `UInt256` type is used to represent a 256-bit unsigned integer, which is the size of the index used to identify storage cells in Ethereum's state trie.
