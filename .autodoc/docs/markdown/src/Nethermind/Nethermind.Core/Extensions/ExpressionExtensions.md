The `ExpressionExtensions` class in the `Nethermind.Core.Extensions` namespace provides extension methods for working with lambda expressions. The purpose of this class is to simplify the process of working with lambda expressions by providing methods to extract information from them and convert them into different forms.

The `GetName` method takes a lambda expression as input and returns the name of the member it refers to. For example, if the lambda expression is `x => x.Property`, the method will return `"Property"`. This method can be useful when working with reflection or other scenarios where you need to know the name of a member at runtime.

The `GetMemberInfo` method takes an expression as input and returns a `MemberExpression` that represents the member being accessed by the expression. This method can be used to extract information about the member being accessed, such as its name, type, or declaring type.

The `GetSetter` method takes a lambda expression that represents a getter for a property and returns a delegate that can be used to set the value of the property. This method can be useful when you need to dynamically set the value of a property at runtime. For example, if you have a class `Person` with a property `Name`, you can use the `GetSetter` method to create a delegate that can set the value of the `Name` property:

```csharp
var person = new Person();
var setName = person.GetName().GetSetter();
setName(person, "Alice");
```

Overall, the `ExpressionExtensions` class provides useful methods for working with lambda expressions in a more convenient way. These methods can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as reflection, dynamic code generation, or data binding.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an extension class for C# expressions, providing methods to get the name of a member and convert a getter expression into a setter expression.

2. What is the meaning of the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment?
   - This comment specifies the license under which the code is released, in this case the LGPL-3.0-only license.

3. What happens if the lambda expression passed to `GetSetter` is not a property?
   - If the lambda expression passed to `GetSetter` is not a property, a `NotSupportedException` is thrown with a message indicating that the member is not a property.
