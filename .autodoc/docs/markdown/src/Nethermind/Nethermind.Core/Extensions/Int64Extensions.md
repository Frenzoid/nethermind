The `Int64Extensions` class provides extension methods for the `long` data type. The purpose of this class is to convert `long` values to and from byte arrays and hexadecimal strings. 

The `ToBigEndianByteArrayWithoutLeadingZeros` method converts a `long` value to a big-endian byte array without leading zeros. It does this by shifting the bits of the `long` value and storing the resulting bytes in a byte array. If the resulting byte array has leading zeros, they are removed. This method is useful for encoding `long` values in a compact way.

The `ToBigEndianByteArray` method converts a `long` value to a big-endian byte array. It does this by using the `BitConverter.GetBytes` method to convert the `long` value to a byte array and then reversing the byte order if the system is little-endian. This method is useful for encoding `long` values in a standard way.

The `ToHexString` method converts a `long` value to a hexadecimal string. It does this by first converting the `long` value to a big-endian byte array using the `BinaryPrimitives.WriteInt64BigEndian` method. It then calls the `ToHexString` method on the resulting byte array to get the hexadecimal string. This method has an optional parameter to skip leading zeros in the resulting string.

The `ToHexString` method also has an overload that takes an unsigned `ulong` value and converts it to a hexadecimal string in the same way as the `long` version.

The `ToHexString` method also has an overload that takes an `UInt256` value and converts it to a hexadecimal string. It does this by first converting the `UInt256` value to a big-endian byte array using the `ToBigEndian` method of the `UInt256` struct. It then calls the `ToHexString` method on the resulting byte array to get the hexadecimal string. This method also has an optional parameter to skip leading zeros in the resulting string.

The `ToLongFromBigEndianByteArrayWithoutLeadingZeros` method converts a big-endian byte array without leading zeros to a `long` value. It does this by iterating over the bytes in the byte array and shifting them to the correct position in the `long` value. If the input byte array is null, this method returns 0.

Overall, the `Int64Extensions` class provides useful methods for encoding and decoding `long` values in byte arrays and hexadecimal strings. These methods are used throughout the larger project to serialize and deserialize data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ToBigEndianByteArrayWithoutLeadingZeros` method?
- The `ToBigEndianByteArrayWithoutLeadingZeros` method converts a long value to a big-endian byte array without leading zeros.

2. What is the purpose of the `ToHexString` method for `UInt256` values?
- The `ToHexString` method for `UInt256` values converts a `UInt256` value to a hexadecimal string representation with an optional flag to skip leading zeros.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetByteBuffer64` and `GetByteBuffer256` methods?
- The `GetByteBuffer64` and `GetByteBuffer256` methods return a thread-static byte array of size 8 and 32 respectively, which are used to store the big-endian byte representation of a long or `UInt256` value.
