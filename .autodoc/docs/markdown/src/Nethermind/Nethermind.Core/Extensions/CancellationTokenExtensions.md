The code provided is a C# class file that contains two extension methods for the CancellationToken class. The CancellationToken class is a part of the System.Threading namespace and is used to signal cancellation to threads that are executing a task. 

The first method, AsTask, is an extension method that converts a CancellationToken to an awaitable Task when the token is cancelled. This method is useful when you want to wait for a CancellationToken to be cancelled before continuing with the execution of a task. The method creates a new TaskCompletionSource object and registers a callback with the CancellationToken that sets the TaskCompletionSource to a cancelled state when the CancellationToken is cancelled. The method then returns the TaskCompletionSource's Task property, which is the awaitable Task that can be used to wait for the CancellationToken to be cancelled. 

Here is an example of how the AsTask method can be used:

```
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
CancellationToken ct = cts.Token;

Task task = Task.Delay(5000, ct).AsTask();

cts.CancelAfter(2000);

try
{
    await task;
}
catch (TaskCanceledException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Task was cancelled.");
}
```

In this example, a CancellationTokenSource is created and a CancellationToken is obtained from it. A Task is created using the CancellationToken's Delay method and the AsTask extension method. The CancellationTokenSource is then cancelled after 2 seconds, which causes the Task to be cancelled. The Task is awaited, and if it is cancelled, a TaskCanceledException is thrown, which is caught and handled by printing a message to the console. 

The second method, CancelDisposeAndClear, is an extension method that cancels and disposes a CancellationTokenSource and sets it to null so that multiple calls to this method are safe and CancellationTokenSource.Cancel() will be called only once. This method is useful when you want to cancel a CancellationTokenSource and dispose of it in a thread-safe manner. The method first creates a local copy of the CancellationTokenSource reference, then uses the Interlocked.CompareExchange method to atomically set the CancellationTokenSource reference to null if it is still equal to the local copy. This ensures that only one thread can cancel and dispose of the CancellationTokenSource. If the CancellationTokenSource reference is not null, the method calls the CancellationTokenSource's Cancel and Dispose methods to cancel and dispose of it. 

Here is an example of how the CancelDisposeAndClear method can be used:

```
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

Task.Run(() =>
{
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    CancellationTokenExtensions.CancelDisposeAndClear(ref cts);
});

cts.Token.WaitHandle.WaitOne();

Console.WriteLine("CancellationTokenSource was cancelled and disposed.");
```

In this example, a CancellationTokenSource is created and a Task is started that waits for 5 seconds before calling the CancelDisposeAndClear method with the CancellationTokenSource reference. The CancellationTokenSource's WaitHandle is then waited on, which blocks until the CancellationTokenSource is cancelled. When the CancellationTokenSource is cancelled, a message is printed to the console. 

Overall, these extension methods provide useful functionality for working with CancellationToken objects in a more convenient and thread-safe manner.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AsTask` method?
    
    The `AsTask` method converts a `CancellationToken` to an awaitable `Task` when the token is cancelled.

2. What does the `CancelDisposeAndClear` method do?
    
    The `CancelDisposeAndClear` method cancels and disposes the `CancellationTokenSource` and sets it to null so that multiple calls to this method are safe and `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()` will be called only once. It uses `Interlocked.CompareExchange` to safely manage reference.
