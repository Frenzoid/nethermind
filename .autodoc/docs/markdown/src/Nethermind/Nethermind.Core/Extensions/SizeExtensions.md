The `SizeExtensions` class provides extension methods to convert between different units of digital storage size. The purpose of this code is to simplify the conversion of storage sizes in the Nethermind project. 

The class contains extension methods for `long` and `int` types to convert between gigabytes (GB), megabytes (MB), and kilobytes (KB) using multiplication. Additionally, there are methods to convert between gibibytes (GiB), mebibytes (MiB), and kibibytes (KiB) using binary multiplication. 

For example, if a developer needs to convert 10 GB to bytes, they can use the `GB` extension method on a `long` or `int` value of 10 as follows:

```
long bytes = 10.GB();
```

This will return the value of 10 GB in bytes. Similarly, if a developer needs to convert 5 MiB to bytes, they can use the `MiB` extension method on a `long` or `int` value of 5 as follows:

```
long bytes = 5.MiB();
```

This will return the value of 5 MiB in bytes. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to convert between different units of digital storage size in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines extension methods for converting between different units of size (KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB) represented as integers or longs.

2. What is the significance of the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace?
- It is unclear from this code what the `Nethermind.Int256` namespace is used for, as it is not referenced in this file. A smart developer might wonder if it is used elsewhere in the project and what its purpose is.

3. Why are the conversion factors for GB, MB, and KB different from the standard binary prefixes?
- A smart developer might question why the conversion factors for GB, MB, and KB are defined as 1_000_000_000L, 1_000_000L, and 1_000L, respectively, instead of the standard binary prefixes of 1024. The reason for this choice is not explained in the code and may be worth documenting for future developers.
