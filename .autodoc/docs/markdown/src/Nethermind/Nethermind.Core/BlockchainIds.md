The `BlockchainIds` class in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace is a static class that defines constants for various blockchain network IDs. Each constant is an integer value that corresponds to a specific blockchain network. The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for developers to reference the network IDs of various blockchains. 

The class includes constants for well-known public Ethereum testnets such as Olympic, Morden, Ropsten, Rinkeby, Goerli, and Kovan. It also includes constants for other public networks such as Rootstock, Ethereum Classic, EnergyWeb, Gnosis, and POA Network. Additionally, it includes constants for private chains such as DefaultGethPrivateChain and Chiado. 

The `GetBlockchainName` method takes a `ulong` network ID as input and returns the name of the corresponding blockchain network as a string. If the input network ID is one of the constants defined in the `BlockchainIds` class, the method returns the name of the corresponding blockchain network. Otherwise, it returns the input network ID as a string. 

This class can be used in the larger project to provide a centralized location for developers to reference the network IDs of various blockchains. For example, if a developer needs to specify the network ID of a blockchain in their code, they can reference the appropriate constant in the `BlockchainIds` class rather than hard-coding the network ID. This can help to reduce errors and make the code more maintainable. 

Example usage:

```
using Nethermind.Core;

int networkId = BlockchainIds.Rinkeby;
string blockchainName = BlockchainIds.GetBlockchainName(networkId);
Console.WriteLine($"The network ID {networkId} corresponds to the {blockchainName} blockchain.");
// Output: The network ID 4 corresponds to the Rinkeby blockchain.
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a static class `BlockchainIds` that contains constants representing various blockchain network IDs and a method `GetBlockchainName` that returns the name of the blockchain network given its ID. It also defines a static class `TestBlockchainIds` that contains constants representing a test network ID and chain ID.

2. What are some examples of blockchain networks represented by the constants in this code?
- Some examples of blockchain networks represented by the constants in this code include Ethereum mainnet (ID 1), Ropsten testnet (ID 3), Rinkeby testnet (ID 4), Kovan testnet (ID 42), and EnergyWeb mainnet (ID 246).

3. What is the purpose of the `GetBlockchainName` method?
- The `GetBlockchainName` method takes a network ID as input and returns the name of the corresponding blockchain network. If the input ID does not match any of the predefined constants, it returns the ID as a string.
