This file contains two custom attributes, `CounterMetricAttribute` and `GaugeMetricAttribute`, that can be used to represent different types of metrics in the Nethermind project. Metrics are used to measure and track various aspects of the system's performance and behavior over time. 

The `CounterMetricAttribute` is used to represent a metric with up/down semantics, meaning that it is incremented or decremented over time. This type of metric is useful for tracking things like the number of requests processed, the number of errors encountered, or the amount of memory used. Here is an example of how this attribute might be used:

```
public class MyService
{
    [CounterMetric]
    private int _requestsProcessed;

    public void ProcessRequest()
    {
        // do some work...
        _requestsProcessed++;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CounterMetricAttribute` is applied to the `_requestsProcessed` field to indicate that it represents a counter metric. The field is then incremented each time a request is processed.

The `GaugeMetricAttribute` is used to represent a metric with an assignment semantics, meaning that it is assigned to a new value over time. This type of metric is useful for tracking things like the current CPU usage, the size of a queue, or the number of active connections. Here is an example of how this attribute might be used:

```
public class MyService
{
    [GaugeMetric]
    private int _activeConnections;

    public void AddConnection()
    {
        // do some work...
        _activeConnections++;
    }

    public void RemoveConnection()
    {
        // do some work...
        _activeConnections--;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `GaugeMetricAttribute` is applied to the `_activeConnections` field to indicate that it represents a gauge metric. The field is then updated each time a connection is added or removed.

Overall, these custom attributes provide a way to annotate code with information about the types of metrics being tracked, which can be used by other parts of the Nethermind project to collect and analyze performance data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Nethermind.Core.Attributes` namespace?
- The `Nethermind.Core.Attributes` namespace contains two classes that represent different types of metrics: `CounterMetricAttribute` and `GaugeMetricAttribute`.

2. What is the difference between `CounterMetricAttribute` and `GaugeMetricAttribute`?
- `CounterMetricAttribute` represents a metric that is incremented or decremented over time, while `GaugeMetricAttribute` represents a metric that is assigned to a new value.

3. What is the purpose of the `AttributeUsage` attribute applied to both `CounterMetricAttribute` and `GaugeMetricAttribute`?
- The `AttributeUsage` attribute specifies where the attribute can be applied in code, in this case to properties or fields.
