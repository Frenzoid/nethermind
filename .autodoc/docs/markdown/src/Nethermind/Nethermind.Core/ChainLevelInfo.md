The `ChainLevelInfo` class is a part of the Nethermind project and is used to store information about a chain level. It contains information about whether a block is on the main chain or not, an array of `BlockInfo` objects, and methods to find the index of a block and to get the main chain block and the beacon main chain block.

The `ChainLevelInfo` constructor takes a boolean value that indicates whether a block is on the main chain and an array of `BlockInfo` objects. The `BlockInfo` class contains information about a block, such as its hash, number, and metadata.

The `HasNonBeaconBlocks` and `HasBeaconBlocks` properties return a boolean value that indicates whether the `BlockInfos` array contains blocks that are not part of the beacon chain or blocks that are part of the beacon chain, respectively.

The `MainChainBlock` property returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array if it is on the main chain, otherwise it returns null.

The `BeaconMainChainBlock` property returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array that has the `BeaconMainChain` metadata flag set, otherwise it returns the first block in the `BlockInfos` array.

The `FindBlockInfoIndex` method takes a `Keccak` hash and returns the index of the `BlockInfo` object in the `BlockInfos` array that has the same hash, or null if it is not found.

This class is used in the Nethermind project to store information about a chain level, which is a set of blocks that are at the same height in the blockchain. It provides methods to find the index of a block, get the main chain block, and get the beacon main chain block. These methods are used by other classes in the project to perform various operations on the blockchain. For example, the `FindBlockInfoIndex` method is used by the `Blockchain` class to find a block in the blockchain by its hash.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainLevelInfo` class?
- The `ChainLevelInfo` class is used to store information about a chain level, including whether it has blocks on the main chain, an array of `BlockInfo` objects, and methods to find block info by hash and determine if the chain level has beacon blocks.

2. What is the significance of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute on the `ChainLevelInfo` class?
- The `DebuggerDisplay` attribute specifies how the `ChainLevelInfo` object should be displayed in the debugger. In this case, it shows whether the chain level has a block on the main chain and the number of blocks in the `BlockInfos` array.

3. What is the purpose of the `BeaconMainChainBlock` property and why does the code suggest that it needs to be rethought?
- The `BeaconMainChainBlock` property is used to find the first block on the beacon chain that is also on the main chain. The code suggests that it needs to be rethought because it currently assumes that the first block info in the `BlockInfos` array is on the main chain, which may not always be the case.
