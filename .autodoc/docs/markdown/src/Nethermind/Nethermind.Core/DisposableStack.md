The `DisposableStack` class in the `Nethermind.Core` namespace is a custom implementation of a stack data structure that can hold objects that implement the `IAsyncDisposable` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to manage a collection of disposable objects that need to be cleaned up when they are no longer needed.

The `DisposableStack` class inherits from the built-in `Stack` class and adds a new method called `Push` that accepts an object that implements the `IAsyncDisposable` interface. This method simply calls the base `Push` method to add the item to the stack.

In addition to the `Push` method that accepts an `IAsyncDisposable` object, the `DisposableStack` class also provides another `Push` method that accepts an object that implements the `IDisposable` interface. This method creates a new instance of the `AsyncDisposableWrapper` class, which is a private nested class that implements the `IAsyncDisposable` interface and wraps the `IDisposable` object. The `AsyncDisposableWrapper` class provides an implementation of the `DisposeAsync` method that calls the `Dispose` method on the wrapped object and returns a default `ValueTask`.

By providing two different `Push` methods, the `DisposableStack` class allows the caller to add either an `IAsyncDisposable` object or an `IDisposable` object to the stack, without having to worry about the implementation details of each object.

Overall, the `DisposableStack` class is a useful utility class that can be used in any part of the `Nethermind` project (or any other project) where there is a need to manage a collection of disposable objects. Here is an example of how the `DisposableStack` class might be used:

```
using Nethermind.Core;

public class MyClass : IAsyncDisposable
{
    private DisposableStack _stack = new DisposableStack();

    public void AddDisposableObject(IDisposable obj)
    {
        _stack.Push(obj);
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        while (_stack.Count > 0)
        {
            var obj = _stack.Pop();
            await obj.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyClass` implements the `IAsyncDisposable` interface and contains a private instance of the `DisposableStack` class. The `AddDisposableObject` method is used to add disposable objects to the stack, and the `DisposeAsync` method is used to dispose of all the objects in the stack when the instance of `MyClass` is no longer needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisposableStack` class?
   - The `DisposableStack` class is a subclass of `Stack<IAsyncDisposable>` and provides additional functionality to push `IDisposable` items onto the stack.

2. Why does the `Push` method take both `IAsyncDisposable` and `IDisposable` parameters?
   - The `Push` method is overloaded to accept both `IAsyncDisposable` and `IDisposable` parameters, but internally it always wraps the `IDisposable` item in an `AsyncDisposableWrapper` object to make it compatible with the `Stack<IAsyncDisposable>` base class.

3. What is the purpose of the `AsyncDisposableWrapper` class?
   - The `AsyncDisposableWrapper` class is a private nested class that wraps an `IDisposable` item and implements the `IAsyncDisposable` interface. It allows `IDisposable` items to be used in a context that requires `IAsyncDisposable` items, such as with the `await using` statement.
