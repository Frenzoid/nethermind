The `AccessListBuilder` class is part of the Nethermind project and is used to store extra information to recreate the order of incoming transactions. This is necessary because of the EIP-2930 specification, which allows duplicates to be included in the access list. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store the order of items and information on duplicates.

The `AccessListBuilder` class contains a dictionary called `_data` that stores the access list data. The keys of the dictionary are addresses, and the values are sets of `UInt256` values. The class also contains a queue called `_orderQueue` that stores the order of the items in the access list. The `_currentAddress` field is used to keep track of the current address being processed.

The `AddAddress` method is used to add an address to the access list. It sets the `_currentAddress` field to the provided address, adds the address to the `_orderQueue`, and creates a new set in the `_data` dictionary if the address is not already present.

The `AddStorage` method is used to add a storage index to the access list. It first checks if an address has been added to the access list by checking if `_currentAddress` is null. If no address has been added, an exception is thrown. Otherwise, the storage index is added to the `_orderQueue` and the corresponding set in the `_data` dictionary.

The `ToAccessList` method is used to create an `AccessList` object from the data stored in the `_data` dictionary and `_orderQueue`.

Overall, the `AccessListBuilder` class provides a way to store and manage the order of items in an access list, which is necessary for complying with the EIP-2930 specification. It can be used in the larger Nethermind project to manage access lists for incoming transactions. Here is an example of how to use the `AccessListBuilder` class:

```
var builder = new AccessListBuilder();
builder.AddAddress(new Address("0x123"));
builder.AddStorage(UInt256.Parse("0x456"));
var accessList = builder.ToAccessList();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccessListBuilder` class?
    
    The `AccessListBuilder` class is used to store and organize information about the access list of incoming transactions, as specified in EIP-2930.

2. Why does the `AccessListBuilder` use a queue structure in addition to a dictionary?
    
    The `AccessListBuilder` uses a queue structure to store the order of items in the access list, since duplicates are allowed and the order of items affects the transaction's validity. The dictionary is used to store the actual data.

3. What is the purpose of the `ToAccessList` method?
    
    The `ToAccessList` method returns an `AccessList` object that contains the data and order information stored in the `AccessListBuilder`. This can be used to construct the access list for a transaction.
