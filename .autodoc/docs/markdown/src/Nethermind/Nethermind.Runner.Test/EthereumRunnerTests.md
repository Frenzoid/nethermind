The `EthereumRunnerTests` class is a test suite for the `EthereumRunner` class in the Nethermind project. The purpose of this test suite is to test the `EthereumRunner` class with different configurations. The `EthereumRunner` class is responsible for starting and stopping the Ethereum node. 

The `InitOnce` method initializes the configuration providers by reading the configuration files from the `configs` directory. The `ChainSpecRunnerTests` property returns a test case for each configuration provider. The `Smoke` and `Smoke_cancel` methods are test cases that run the `SmokeTest` method with a configuration provider and a base port. The `SmokeTest` method initializes the configuration, starts the Ethereum node, and stops the Ethereum node. 

The `SmokeTest` method initializes the configuration by setting the base database path and the P2P and discovery ports. It then creates an instance of the `ApiBuilder` class with the configuration provider and the `LimboLogs` logger. The `ApiBuilder` class creates an instance of the `NethermindApi` class with the configuration provider and the logger. It then sets the `RpcModuleProvider` property of the `NethermindApi` class with a new instance of the `RpcModuleProvider` class. The `RpcModuleProvider` class is responsible for providing the JSON-RPC modules. 

The `SmokeTest` method then creates an instance of the `EthereumRunner` class with the `NethermindApi` instance. It then starts the Ethereum node with a new `CancellationTokenSource` instance. If the `cancel` parameter is `true`, it cancels the `CancellationTokenSource` instance. It then waits for the Ethereum node to stop. If an exception occurs, it catches the exception and stores it in the `exception` variable. Finally, it stops the Ethereum node and disposes of the temporary directory. 

The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `EthereumRunner` class can start and stop the Ethereum node with different configurations. The `EthereumRunner` class is a critical component of the Nethermind project, and it is essential to ensure that it works correctly with different configurations. The `SmokeTest` method is a comprehensive test that covers the initialization, starting, and stopping of the Ethereum node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InitOnce` method and how is it used in the code?
   
   The `InitOnce` method pre-caches configuration providers to make the tests do less work. It is used to initialize a static lazy collection of configuration providers that is used in the `ChainSpecRunnerTests` property.

2. What is the purpose of the `SmokeTest` method and what parameters does it take?
   
   The `SmokeTest` method is used to run a smoke test on a given configuration provider. It takes a `ConfigProvider` object, an integer `testIndex`, an integer `basePort`, and a boolean `cancel` parameter.

3. What is the purpose of the `ChainSpecRunnerTests` property and how is it used in the code?
   
   The `ChainSpecRunnerTests` property is an IEnumerable that returns a TestCaseData object for each cached provider in the `_cachedProviders` collection. It is used as a data source for the `Smoke` and `Smoke_cancel` test cases.
