This code defines a static class called `Build` that provides a method called `ContextWithMocks()`. This method returns an instance of the `NethermindApi` class, which is a central class in the Nethermind project that provides access to various services and components of the Ethereum node implementation. 

The purpose of this method is to create a mock instance of the `NethermindApi` class that can be used for testing purposes. The method uses the `Substitute.For<T>()` method from the NSubstitute library to create mock objects for each of the services and components that the `NethermindApi` class depends on. These mock objects are then passed to the constructor of the `NethermindApi` class to create a fully functional instance that can be used for testing.

The `NethermindApi` class is used extensively throughout the Nethermind project to provide access to various services and components of the Ethereum node implementation. By creating a mock instance of this class, developers can test their code without having to run a full Ethereum node. This can be useful for unit testing and integration testing, as it allows developers to isolate their code and test it in a controlled environment.

Here is an example of how the `ContextWithMocks()` method might be used in a test:

```
[Test]
public void TestMyCode()
{
    // Create a mock instance of the NethermindApi class
    var api = Build.ContextWithMocks();

    // Use the mock instance to test my code
    var result = MyCodeUnderTest(api);

    // Assert that the result is correct
    Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result);
}
```

Overall, this code is an important part of the Nethermind project's testing infrastructure, as it provides a way for developers to test their code in a controlled environment without having to run a full Ethereum node.
