The code above defines a class called `DisconnectDetails` within the `Nethermind.Stats.Model` namespace. This class has two properties: `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason`, both of which are of custom enum types.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store information about a disconnection event in the Nethermind project. The `DisconnectType` property specifies the type of disconnection that occurred, while the `DisconnectReason` property provides additional information about why the disconnection occurred.

This class can be used in various parts of the Nethermind project where disconnection events need to be tracked and analyzed. For example, it could be used in a network monitoring module to keep track of nodes that have disconnected from the network and the reasons for their disconnection.

Here is an example of how this class could be used in code:

```
DisconnectDetails details = new DisconnectDetails();
details.DisconnectType = DisconnectType.NetworkError;
details.DisconnectReason = DisconnectReason.Timeout;

// Use the details object to log the disconnection event or perform other actions
```

In this example, a new `DisconnectDetails` object is created and its properties are set to indicate that a disconnection occurred due to a network error and a timeout. The object can then be used to log the event or perform other actions as needed.

Overall, the `DisconnectDetails` class provides a simple and flexible way to store information about disconnection events in the Nethermind project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DisconnectDetails` class?
   - The `DisconnectDetails` class is used to store information about a disconnection event, including the type and reason for the disconnection.

2. What are the possible values for `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason`?
   - Without additional information, it is unclear what the possible values for `DisconnectType` and `DisconnectReason` are. These values may be defined elsewhere in the codebase or in external documentation.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX license identifier?
   - The SPDX license identifier indicates the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
