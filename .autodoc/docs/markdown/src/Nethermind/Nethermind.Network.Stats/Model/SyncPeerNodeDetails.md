The code above defines a class called `SyncPeerNodeDetails` that is used to store information about a peer node that is syncing with the Nethermind client. The class has five properties: `ProtocolVersion`, `NetworkId`, `TotalDifficulty`, `BestHash`, and `GenesisHash`.

The `ProtocolVersion` property is a byte that represents the version of the Ethereum protocol that the peer node is using. The `NetworkId` property is an unsigned long integer that represents the network ID of the Ethereum network that the peer node is connected to. The `TotalDifficulty` property is a `BigInteger` that represents the total difficulty of the blockchain that the peer node is syncing with. The `BestHash` property is a `Keccak` hash that represents the hash of the block that the peer node considers to be the best block in the blockchain. The `GenesisHash` property is a `Keccak` hash that represents the hash of the genesis block of the blockchain.

This class is likely used in the larger Nethermind project to keep track of the syncing status of peer nodes. When a peer node connects to the Nethermind client and starts syncing with the blockchain, the client can use an instance of this class to store information about the peer node's syncing progress. For example, the client can update the `TotalDifficulty` property of the `SyncPeerNodeDetails` instance as the peer node downloads and verifies more blocks from the blockchain. The client can also use the `BestHash` property to compare the syncing progress of different peer nodes and choose the one that is closest to the current state of the blockchain.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Nethermind project:

```
SyncPeerNodeDetails peerDetails = new SyncPeerNodeDetails();
peerDetails.ProtocolVersion = 63;
peerDetails.NetworkId = 1;
peerDetails.TotalDifficulty = BigInteger.Parse("12345678901234567890");
peerDetails.BestHash = new Keccak("0x1234567890abcdef");
peerDetails.GenesisHash = new Keccak("0xabcdef1234567890");

// Use the peerDetails instance to keep track of the syncing progress of a peer node
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SyncPeerNodeDetails` class?
   - The `SyncPeerNodeDetails` class is used to store details about a syncing peer node, such as its protocol version, network ID, total difficulty, and hashes.

2. What is the significance of the `Keccak` type?
   - The `Keccak` type is used to represent a Keccak hash, which is a type of cryptographic hash function. In this code, it is used to store the best hash and genesis hash of a syncing peer node.

3. What is the license for this code?
