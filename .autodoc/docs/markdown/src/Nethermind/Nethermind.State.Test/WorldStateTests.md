The `WorldStateTests` class is a test suite for the `WorldState` class in the `Nethermind` project. The `WorldState` class is responsible for managing the state and storage of the Ethereum blockchain. The tests in this class verify that the `WorldState` class correctly interacts with its dependencies, the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` interfaces.

The first test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_invokes_take_snapshot_on_both_providers()`, verifies that when the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on a `WorldState` instance, it calls the `TakeSnapshot()` method on both the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` instances that were passed to the constructor. This test ensures that the `WorldState` class correctly delegates the snapshot-taking responsibility to its dependencies.

The second test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_return_the_same_value_as_both()`, verifies that when the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on a `WorldState` instance, it returns a `Snapshot` object with the same values for `StateSnapshot` and `PersistentStorageSnapshot` as the `TakeSnapshot()` method of the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` instances, respectively. This test ensures that the `WorldState` class correctly aggregates the snapshot data from its dependencies.

The third test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_return_non_zero_snapshot_value()`, verifies that when the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on a `WorldState` instance, it returns a `Snapshot` object with non-zero values for `StateSnapshot`, `PersistentStorageSnapshot`, and `TransientStorageSnapshot`. This test ensures that the `WorldState` class correctly handles non-zero snapshot data from its dependencies.

The fourth test, `When_taking_a_snapshot_can_specify_transaction_boundary()`, verifies that when the `TakeSnapshot()` method is called on a `WorldState` instance with a `true` argument, it calls the `TakeSnapshot(true)` method on the `IStorageProvider` instance that was passed to the constructor. This test ensures that the `WorldState` class correctly delegates the transaction boundary specification to its `IStorageProvider` dependency.

The fifth test, `Can_restore_snapshot()`, verifies that when the `Restore()` method is called on a `WorldState` instance with a `Snapshot` object, it calls the `Restore()` method on both the `IStateProvider` and `IStorageProvider` instances that were passed to the constructor with the appropriate arguments. This test ensures that the `WorldState` class correctly delegates the snapshot restoration responsibility to its dependencies.

Overall, the `WorldStateTests` class provides a suite of tests to ensure that the `WorldState` class correctly interacts with its dependencies and performs its intended functions. These tests are important for maintaining the correctness and reliability of the `Nethermind` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WorldState` class?
- The `WorldState` class is used to take and restore snapshots of the state and storage providers.

2. What is the significance of the `FluentAssertions` and `NSubstitute` namespaces?
- The `FluentAssertions` namespace is used for fluent assertions in the tests, while the `NSubstitute` namespace is used for creating substitute objects for the state and storage providers.

3. What is the difference between `snapshot.StorageSnapshot.PersistentStorageSnapshot` and `snapshot.StorageSnapshot.TransientStorageSnapshot`?
- `snapshot.StorageSnapshot.PersistentStorageSnapshot` represents the persistent storage snapshot value, while `snapshot.StorageSnapshot.TransientStorageSnapshot` represents the transient storage snapshot value.
