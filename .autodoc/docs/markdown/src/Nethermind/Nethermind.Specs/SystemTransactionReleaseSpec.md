The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class is a part of the Nethermind project and implements the `IReleaseSpec` interface. It provides a way to access the release specifications for the Ethereum network. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to access the release specifications for the Ethereum network. 

The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class takes an instance of `IReleaseSpec` as a constructor argument and delegates all of its properties to the wrapped instance. This allows for easy extension of the release specifications without having to modify the existing code. 

The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class provides access to various properties that define the Ethereum network's release specifications. These properties include `IsEip4844Enabled`, `Name`, `MaximumExtraDataSize`, `MaxCodeSize`, `MinGasLimit`, `GasLimitBoundDivisor`, `BlockReward`, `DifficultyBombDelay`, `DifficultyBoundDivisor`, `FixedDifficulty`, `MaximumUncleCount`, `IsTimeAdjustmentPostOlympic`, and many more. 

For example, to check if EIP-1559 is enabled, one can use the `IsEip1559Enabled` property. Similarly, to get the maximum code size, one can use the `MaxCodeSize` property. 

Overall, the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class provides a convenient way to access the release specifications for the Ethereum network. It allows for easy extension of the release specifications and provides a consistent interface for accessing them.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class?
- The `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class is a release specification that implements the `IReleaseSpec` interface and provides information about the enabled EIPs, block rewards, gas limits, and other parameters for the system transaction.

2. What is the significance of the `_spec` field in the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` constructor?
- The `_spec` field is a reference to another `IReleaseSpec` object that is used to delegate some of the properties and methods of the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` class. This allows the `SystemTransactionReleaseSpec` to inherit some of the properties and behavior of the underlying release specification.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsEip158Enabled` property?
- The `IsEip158Enabled` property returns a boolean value indicating whether EIP-158 is enabled in the release specification. EIP-158 is a gas cost reduction for SSTORE operations, which can improve the efficiency of smart contract execution.
