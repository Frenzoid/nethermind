The `ChainSpecSealJson` class is a part of the `Nethermind` project and is used to define the seal data for a chain specification in JSON format. The class contains two properties, `Ethereum` and `AuthorityRound`, which are instances of the `ChainSpecEthereumSealJson` and `ChainSpecAuRaSealJson` classes respectively. 

The `Ethereum` property is used to define the Ethereum-specific seal data for the chain specification, while the `AuthorityRound` property is used to define the AuthorityRound-specific seal data. 

The `ChainSpecEthereumSealJson` and `ChainSpecAuRaSealJson` classes are likely used to define the specific seal data for the Ethereum and AuthorityRound consensus algorithms respectively. 

This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and components in the `Nethermind` project to define and configure a chain specification for a blockchain network. 

Example usage:

```csharp
ChainSpecSealJson chainSpecSeal = new ChainSpecSealJson();
chainSpecSeal.Ethereum = new ChainSpecEthereumSealJson();
chainSpecSeal.AuthorityRound = new ChainSpecAuRaSealJson();
// set properties for Ethereum and AuthorityRound seals
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `ChainSpecSealJson` within the `Nethermind.Specs.ChainSpecStyle.Json` namespace, which has two properties of type `ChainSpecEthereumSealJson` and `ChainSpecAuRaSealJson`.

2. What is the significance of the `internal` access modifier used for the `ChainSpecSealJson` class?
   - The `internal` access modifier means that the `ChainSpecSealJson` class can only be accessed within the same assembly (i.e., the same project), and not from other assemblies.

3. What is the purpose of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file?
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the LGPL-3.0-only license.
