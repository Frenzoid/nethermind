The `TraceStorePlugin` class is a plugin for the Nethermind project that allows for serving traces without the block state by saving historical traces to a database. The plugin is initialized with an instance of the `INethermindApi` interface, which provides access to various components of the Nethermind node.

The plugin is enabled if the `Enabled` property is true, which is determined by the `ITraceStoreConfig` configuration object. If the plugin is enabled, the plugin initializes the following components:

- Serialization: The plugin sets up a `ParityLikeTraceSerializer` object for serializing traces. The serializer is configured with the maximum depth of traces to serialize and whether to verify the serialized data.
- Database: The plugin creates a RocksDB database with the name "TraceStore" and registers it with the `IDbProvider` component of the Nethermind node. The database is used to store historical traces.
- Pruning: If configured, the plugin sets up a `TraceStorePruner` object for pruning old traces. The pruner is configured with the number of blocks to keep and the `IBlockTree` component of the Nethermind node.

The plugin also initializes tracing for the Nethermind node by adding a `DbPersistingBlockTracer` object to the `Tracers` collection of the `IBlockchainProcessor` component. The `DbPersistingBlockTracer` object wraps a `ParityLikeBlockTracer` object and persists traces to the database using the `ParityLikeTraceSerializer`.

Finally, the plugin initializes an RPC module for serving traces over JSON-RPC. The module is registered with the `IRpcModuleProvider` component of the Nethermind node and is configured with a `TraceStoreModuleFactory` object. The `TraceStoreModuleFactory` object creates instances of the `TraceStoreRpcModule` class, which serves trace requests by querying the database.

Overall, the `TraceStorePlugin` class provides a way to store and serve historical traces for the Nethermind node. This can be useful for debugging and analysis purposes, as it allows developers to inspect the execution of past transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
    
    This code is a plugin for the Nethermind Ethereum client that allows for serving traces without the block state by saving historical traces to a database. It solves the problem of needing to have the full block state in order to serve traces.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several other Nethermind packages, including `Nethermind.Api`, `Nethermind.Blockchain.Find`, `Nethermind.Db`, `Nethermind.Evm.Tracing.ParityStyle`, and `Nethermind.JsonRpc.Modules`.

3. What is the role of the `InitRpcModules` method?
    
    The `InitRpcModules` method is responsible for initializing the plugin's RPC modules, which allow for serving traces over the JSON-RPC API. It registers a `TraceStoreModuleFactory` with the `IRpcModuleProvider` to handle trace requests.
