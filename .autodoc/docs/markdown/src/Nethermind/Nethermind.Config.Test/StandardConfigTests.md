The `StandardConfigTests` class is responsible for validating the default values and descriptions of properties in configuration files. It contains three methods: `ValidateDefaultValues()`, `ValidateDescriptions()`, and `ForEachProperty()`. 

The `ValidateDefaultValues()` method checks that the default values of properties in configuration files are set correctly. It does this by calling the `ForEachProperty()` method and passing in the `CheckDefault()` method as a parameter. The `CheckDefault()` method checks that the default value of each property matches the expected value. If the default value is not set or is set incorrectly, an `AssertionException` is thrown.

The `ValidateDescriptions()` method checks that each property in configuration files has a description. It does this by calling the `ForEachProperty()` method and passing in the `CheckDescribedOrHidden()` method as a parameter. The `CheckDescribedOrHidden()` method checks that each property has a description and is not hidden from documentation. If a property is missing a description or is hidden from documentation, an `AssertionException` is thrown.

The `ForEachProperty()` method loops through all configuration files in the `Nethermind` project and verifies each property in each configuration file. It does this by loading each configuration file as an assembly, getting all exported types that implement the `IConfig` interface, and then checking each property of each type. For each property, it calls the verifier method passed in as a parameter (`CheckDefault()` or `CheckDescribedOrHidden()`). If an exception is thrown during the verification process, the method throws a new exception with the name of the property that caused the exception.

Overall, the `StandardConfigTests` class is an important part of the `Nethermind` project as it ensures that all configuration files have correct default values and descriptions. This helps to prevent errors and confusion when using the project. Below is an example of how the `ValidateDefaultValues()` method can be used:

```
[Test]
public void TestDefaultValues()
{
    StandardConfigTests.ValidateDefaultValues();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a set of static methods that validate the default values and descriptions of properties in configuration classes that implement the `IConfig` interface.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code depends on the `NUnit.Framework` and `System` namespaces.

3. What is the expected behavior if a configuration property has no description and is not hidden from documentation?
   
   If a configuration property has no description and is not hidden from documentation, an `AssertionException` will be thrown with a message indicating the name of the configuration property and the fact that it has no description and is in the documentation.
